    <p>The valley of the Stour, in Suffolk, was Constable’s birthplace and frequently appears as a leitmotif in his work. His preferred compositions make use of the volatility of natural forces such as cloud formations and trees bent by the wind; painting en plein air prefigured the Barbizon painters. His highly suggestive response to nature, often compared to Wordsworth’s poetry, would influence Géricault, Delacroix, and, later on, the French Impressionists. We can also see the extent to which Constable was himself indebted to Rubens, Ruisdael, and Gainsborough. Constable’s expressive style in Netley Abbey is punctuated with flashes of white brushstrokes which heighten the drama of this small, dynamic work. The darkened trees establish a frame for the stone-grey Gothic arches of the Abbey; the hovering birds in a turbulent sky of brown, apricot, and dull blue serve to intensify the moody, romantic setting. We hardly notice the two unobtrusive figures to the left, suggested by red and blue spots of pigment. Their individuality is absorbed by the imposing details of the Abbey and landscape, which Constable considered “experiments in natural philosophy.”</p>

    <p>Netley Abbey is a ruined late medieval monastery in the village of Netley near Southampton in Hampshire, England. The abbey was founded in 1239 as a house for Roman Catholic monks of the austere Cistercian order. Despite being a royal abbey, Netley was never rich, produced no influential scholars nor churchmen, and its nearly 300-year history was quiet. The monks were best known to their neighbours for the generous hospitality they offered to travellers on land and sea.
    
    In 1536, Netley Abbey was closed by Henry VIII of England during the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the building was converted into a mansion by William Paulet, a wealthy Tudor politician. The abbey was used as a country house until the beginning of the eighteenth century, after which it was abandoned and partially demolished for building materials. Subsequently the ruins became a tourist attraction, and provided inspiration to poets and artists of the Romantic movement. In the early twentieth century the site was given to the nation, and it is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument, cared for by English Heritage. The extensive remains consist of the church, cloister buildings, abbot's house, and fragments of the post-Dissolution mansion. Netley Abbey is one of the best preserved medieval Cistercian monasteries in southern England.
