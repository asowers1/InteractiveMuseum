<a id="heilbrunnLink1" href="#"><strong>Mary Stevenson Cassatt (1844&ndash;1926)</strong></a></br>
<div id="heilbrunn1">

<P><P>Mary Stevenson Cassatt (1844&#150;1926), born in Allegheny City (now part of Pittsburgh), Pennsylvania, spent her early years with her family in France and Germany. From 1860 to 1862, she studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. By 1865, she had convinced her parents to let her study in Paris</A>, where she took private lessons from leading academic painter Jean-L&eacute;on G&eacute;r&ocirc;me, copied works of the old masters, and went sketching. She stayed in Courance and &Eacute;couen and studied with &Eacute;douard Fr&egrave;re and Paul Soyer. In 1868, Cassatt's painting <em>The Mandolin Player</em> (private collection) was accepted at the Paris Salon</a>, the first time her work was represented there. After three-and-a-half years in France, the Franco-Prussian War interrupted Cassatt's studies and she returned to Philadelphia in the late summer of 1870.</P></P>



		<p><P>Cassatt returned to Europe in 1871. She spent eight months in Parma, Italy, in 1872, studying the paintings of Correggio and Parmigianino</a> and working with the advice of Carlo Raimondi, head of the department of engraving</A> at the Parma Academy. In 1873, she visited Spain, Belgium, and Holland to study and copy the works of Vel&aacute;zquez</a>, Rubens</a>, and Hals. In June 1874, Cassatt settled in Paris, where she began to show regularly in the Salons, and where her parents and sister Lydia joined her in 1877. That same year, Edgar Degas</a> invited her to join the group of independent artists later known as the Impressionists</a>. The only American officially associated with the group, Cassatt exhibited in four of their eight exhibitions, in 1879, 1880, 1881, and 1886. Under their influence, Cassatt revised her technique, composition, and use of color and light, manifesting her admiration for the works of the French savant garde, especially Degas and Manet</a>. Degas, her chief mentor, provided criticism of her work, offered advice on technique, and encouraged her experiments in printmaking</a>. Like Degas, she was chiefly interested in figure compositions. During the late 1870s and early 1880s, the subjects of her works were her family (especially her sister Lydia), the theater, and the opera</a>. Later she made a specialty of the mother and child</a> theme, which she treated with warmth and naturalness in paintings, pastels</a>, and prints.<br /><br />Cassatt's role as an advisor to art collectors benefited many public and private collections in the United States. From her early days in Paris, she encouraged the collection of old masters and the French avant-garde. In 1901, she accompanied Mr. and Mrs. H. O. Havemeyer on a collecting trip in Italy and Spain. Cassatt had known Mrs. Havemeyer before her marriage. In 1873, she had encouraged the then seventeen-year-old Louisine Elder to buy a pastel by Degas, and the two women became close friends. Cassatt was eventually instrumental in shaping the Havemeyer collection, most of which is now in the Metropolitan Museum.<br /><br />Failing eyesight severely curtailed Cassatt's work after 1900. She gave up printmaking in 1901, and in 1904 stopped painting. She spent most of the war years in Grasse and died in 1926 at her country home, Ch&acirc;teau de Beaufresne, at Mesnil-Theribus, Oise.</P>

<a id="heilbrunnLink2" href="#"><strong>Claude Monet (1840&ndash;1926)</strong></a></br>
<div id="heilbrunn2">

<P><P>Claude Monet was a key figure in the Impressionist</A> movement that transformed French painting in the second half of the nineteenth century. Throughout his long career, Monet consistently depicted the landscape and leisure activities of Paris and its environs as well as the Normandy coast. He led the way to twentieth-century modernism by developing a unique style that strove to capture on canvas the very act of perceiving nature.


		<p><P>Monet found subjects in his immediate surroundings, as he painted the people and places he knew best. His first wife, Camille (2002.62.1</a>), and his second wife, Alice, frequently served as models. His landscapes chart journeys around the north of France (31.67.11</a>) and to London, where he escaped the Franco-Prussian War of 1870&#150;71. Returning to France, Monet moved first to Argenteuil, just fifteen minutes from Paris by train, then west to V&eacute;theuil, Poissy, and finally to the more rural Giverny in 1883. His homes and gardens became gathering places for friends, including Manet</a> and Renoir, who often painted alongside their host (1976.201.14</a>). Yet Monet's paintings cast a surprisingly objective eye on these scenes, which include few signs of domestic relations.<br /><br />Following in the path of the Barbizon painters</a>, who had set up their easels in the Fontainebleau Forest (64.210</A>) earlier in the century, Monet adopted and extended their commitment to close observation and naturalistic representation. Whereas the Barbizon artists painted only preliminary sketches <em>en plein air</em>, Monet often worked directly on large-scale canvases out of doors, then reworked and completed them in his studio. His quest to capture nature more accurately also prompted him to reject European conventions governing composition, color, and perspective. Influenced by Japanese woodblock prints</A>, Monet's asymmetrical arrangements of forms emphasized their two-dimensional surfaces by eliminating linear perspective and abandoning three-dimensional modeling. He brought a vibrant brightness to his works by using unmediated colors, adding a range of tones to his shadows, and preparing canvases with light-colored primers instead of the dark grounds used in traditional landscape paintings</a>.<br /><br />Monet's interest in recording perceptual processes reached its apogee in his series paintings (e.g., <em>Haystacks</em> [1891], <em>Poplars</em> [1892], <em>Rouen Cathedral</em> [1894]) that dominate his output in the 1890s. In each series, Monet painted the same site again and again, recording how its appearance changed with the time of day. Light and shadow seem as substantial as stone in his Rouen Cathedral (30.95.250</a>) series. Monet reports that he rented a room across from the cathedral's western facade in 1892 and 1893, where he kept multiple canvases in process and moved from one to the next as the light shifted. In 1894, he reworked the canvases to their finished states.<br /><br />In the 1910s and '20s, Monet focused almost exclusively on the picturesque water-lily pond (1983.532</a>) that he created on his property at Giverny. His final series depicts the pond in a set of mural-sized canvases where abstract renderings of plant and water emerge from broad strokes of color and intricately built-up textures. Shortly after Monet died (a wealthy and well-respected man at the age of eighty-six), the French government installed his last water-lily series in specially constructed galleries at the Orangerie in Paris, where they remain today.</P>

<a id="heilbrunnLink3" href="#"><strong>The Print in the Nineteenth Century</strong></a></br>
<div id="heilbrunn3">

<P><P>The production of pictures (like the population and most goods and services) increased exponentially in the wake of the Industrial Revolution. Images printed in multiples by a variety of processes were circulated in newspapers, journals, magazines, and books that proliferated at an astounding rate. Where eighteenth-century publications had been illustrated usually with copperplate etchings and engravings, in the nineteenth century, a broad array of new techniques was introduced that included wood engraving, lithography, and a range of photomechanical means of reproduction that steadily took over the field as the century advanced. But as publishers became more and more adept at reproducing images rapidly and in large numbers for the mass media, many artists, seemingly looking backwards, reexamined the special qualities of prints made by hand, particularly those in the etching</a> process, and adopted the technique in order to make fine prints available to a new and growing audience of art collectors.</P></P>



		<p><P>The invention of lithography</a> around 1800 made it possible to produce an extraordinarily large edition of prints from a single drawing executed on a block of limestone. The novelty of lithography, its easy production, and its dramatic, fluid effects attracted young Romantic artists</a> like Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix (67.630.7</a>), and its commercial possibilities were quickly recognized by the popular press. In journals such as the Parisian <em>Charivari</em>, which promised its readers "a new drawing every day," the great caricaturist Honor&eacute; Daumier (20.60.5</a>) presented the comedies and tragedies of contemporary life to as many as 2,000 subscribers. At the end of the century, technological advances that allowed lithographs to be printed in very large sizes and in multiple colors jump-started the industry of advertising and the production of eye-catching posters by such artists as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec</a> (32.88.12</a>).<br /><br />Wood engravings, made from endgrain woodblocks carved in relief, frequently illustrated newspapers and books since they could be inked and printed easily with letterpress type. Literary classics lavishly illustrated with wood engravings by Gustave Dor&eacute; (21.36.133</a>) set the standard for the picture books of the day.<br /><br />However, as if to revolt against the mass production of pictures, many artists participated in the Etching Revival and took inspiration from the expressive prints of Rembrandt</a> and Goya</a>. The virtues of finely drawn and carefully printed etchings were promoted by landscape painters</a> of the Barbizon School</a> and the American expatriate James McNeil Whistler</a> (17.3.85</a>). Although the graphic arts, in the labored precision of their production, were generally viewed as antithetical to the Impressionists' aims to produce fugitive, atmospheric effects, &Eacute;douard Manet</a> (1980.1077</a>), Edgar Degas</a> (19.29.2</a>), and Camille Pissarro (21.46.1</a>) extended their reach by exploring the possibilities of etching, aquatint</a>, and lithography. Degas, the finest draftsman of these three painters, experimented in making monotypes by printing onto paper images he had worked up in ink on sheets of glass or metal.<br /><br />Many Impressionists</a> and Post-Impressionists</a> felt the impact of exotic prints that arrived in Europe from Japan</a> after trade routes were reestablished in 1854. The techniques, compositions, and day-to-day subjects characteristic of <em>ukiyo-e</em> woodcuts</a> figure in the color drypoints of Mary Cassatt</a> (16.2.5</a>), the Philadelphian who made her home in Paris, and in the carved block prints of Paul Gauguin</a> (36.6.4</a>) the Parisian who sailed the South Seas.</P>

<a id="heilbrunnLink4" href="#"><strong>American Impressionism</strong></a></br>
<div id="heilbrunn4">

<P><P>After the end of the Civil War</a> in 1865, the United States gained unprecedented international political and economic status. American art patrons&#151;notably Northerners who had made fortunes from the war&#151;traveled abroad and imbibed European culture. To announce their wealth and sophistication, they built grand houses and filled them with imported decorative arts and paintings by old masters and contemporary academics. To appeal to prospective patrons, aspiring American artists studied in Europe, especially Paris.</P></P>



		<p><P>Soon after Americans began earnestly to collect and emulate European art, the French Impressionists</A> made their debut in a private exhibition in Paris in 1874; they would show together eight times in all, until 1886. Rejecting the academics' devotion to invented subjects and meticulous technique, Impressionist painters depicted landscapes and intimate scenes of everyday middle-class life</a> using natural light, rapid brushwork, and a high-keyed palette. Young Americans in Paris</A> in the 1870s, studying with academic teachers such as Jean-L&eacute;on G&eacute;r&ocirc;me, ignored Impressionism. The few who took note of the radical style were repelled. After visiting the third group exhibition in the spring of 1877, J. Alden Weir wrote to his parents: "I never in my life saw more horrible things&#133;. They do not observe drawing nor form but give you an impression of what they call nature. It was worse than the Chamber of Horrors."<br /><br />There were exceptions to the American disdain of Impressionism during its early years. Pennsylvania-born Mary Cassatt</a>, who moved to Paris in 1874, was sympathetic. Her work attracted the attention of Edgar Degas</A>, who, in 1877, invited her to exhibit with the group. John Singer Sargent</a>, born in Florence to expatriate American parents and studying in Paris by 1874, met Claude Monet</a> two years later and was inspired by him and his colleagues to paint lively urban scenes.<br /><br />During the mid-1880s, as French Impressionism lost its radical edge, American collectors began to value the style, and more American artists began to experiment with it after absorbing academic fundamentals. Exhibitions of Impressionist works were held in American cities and sales were strong. In 1886, with a series of brilliant images of New York's new public parks, William Merritt Chase</a> became the first major American painter to create Impressionist canvases in the United States. At about the same time, Americans began to visit artists' colonies that centered on outdoor painting, most notably Giverny, where Monet had settled in 1883. Those who sought inspiration there included Sargent, Willard Metcalf, and Theodore Robinson, who transmitted Monet's ideas to his compatriots back in the United States.<br /><br /><P>By the early 1890s, Impressionism was firmly established as a valid style of painting for American artists. Even Weir was a convert. Most of the repatriated American Impressionists lived in the Northeast, tapping into the cultural energy that was increasingly concentrated in New York. Some of them taught in the new art schools that were a consequence of the growing professionalism; others conducted summer classes dedicated to Impressionism, as Chase did on the east end of Long Island from 1891 until 1902 and as John Henry Twachtman did in Cos Cob, Connecticut, during the 1890s.<br /><br />The American Impressionists were much more cosmopolitan than their French counterparts. Several were expatriates or spent long periods in Europe; those who repatriated often crossed the Atlantic to attend exhibitions, visit museums, and work in artists' colonies. In Europe and the United States, the American Impressionists witnessed the transformation from an agrarian to an industrialized urban society. They were simultaneously excited by change and nostalgic for the reassuring and familiar past.<br /><br />While some American artists adopted only the surface effects of Impressionism, simply to accommodate collectors' evolving taste, many of them shared the French Impressionists' conviction that modern life should be recorded in a vibrant modern style. Their works, like those of their French counterparts, appear to be infused not only with light and color but with meanings inherent in the subjects they depicted. Some were captivated by the energy of urban life, responding to the fragmented experience that marked the age in rapidly rendered vignettes. Childe Hassam</a>, for example, caught the flavor of characteristic neighborhoods in New York and Paris. But most American Impressionists chose to portray the countryside to which urbanites like themselves and their patrons retreated. Many favored artists' colonies, especially those with architecture and activities that evoked a more tranquil era. In England, for example, Sargent found respite from the portrait studio by painting pastoral scenes in Broadway, a charming village in the Cotswolds. Repatriated Impressionists founded and frequented similarly picturesque colonies: the Isles of Shoals, off the New Hampshire coast, where Hassam painted, and Southampton, New York, where Chase taught and worked. Some American Impressionists worked alone in other distinctive rural locales. Twachtman found inspiration on his farm in Greenwich, Connecticut.<br /><br />Vignettes of domestic life also engaged the American Impressionists. Cassatt, Edmund Tarbell, Frank W. Benson, and others often depicted women and children in tranquil interiors and gardens that ignored or denied the epochal changes taking place beyond their walls.<br /><br />Many American artists worked in the Impressionist style into the 1920s, but innovation had long since waned. By 1910, the less genteel approach of urban realists known as the Ashcan School</a> had emerged. In 1913, the immense display of avant-garde European art at the Armory Show made even the Ashcan School seem old-fashioned. Nevertheless, the American Impressionists' focus on familiar subjects and rapid technique left an indelible mark on American painting. Their works bear witness to their creators' experiences abroad and at home, and offer tantalizing reflections of a dynamic period as well as enchanting records of color and light.</P>

<a id="heilbrunnLink5" href="#"><strong>Edgar Degas (1834&ndash;1917): Bronze Sculpture</strong></a></br>
<div id="heilbrunn5">

<P><P>Degas' sculpture stands outside the mainstream of nineteenth-century French sculpture. He was never interested in creating public monuments, and, with one exception, neither did he display his sculpture publicly. The exception was <em>The Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer</em>. It was shown in the sixth Impressionist exhibition held in Paris in 1881, but the work has little to do with Impressionism</A>. Modeled in wax and wearing a real bodice, stockings, shoes, tulle skirt, and horsehair wig with a satin ribbon, the figure astonished Degas' contemporaries, not only for its unorthodox use of materials, but also and above all for its realism, judged brutish by some. <em>The Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer</em> was not seen again publicly until April 1920.</P></P>



		<p><P>The rest of his sculpture remained a private medium, akin to sketches or drawings, in which Degas, limiting himself to a small range of subjects, explored the problems that fascinated him. The human figures often repeat the same subject, each displaying subtle variations in composition or in the dynamics of movement or of muscular tensions within the body. For many of them, the artist found a ready source of inspiration in the ballet dancers</a> of the Paris Op&eacute;ra. Others recorded women in various stages of washing and drying themselves that provided the opportunity for depicting female nudity in an unidealized fashion. The same painstaking observation went into his modeling of horses. Numerous visits to the racetrack at Longchamp were supplemented by careful scrutiny of photographs, especially the studies of horses in motion made in the 1870s and 1880s by the English photographer Eadweard Muybridge (1830&#150;1904).</p><p>Upon Degas' death in 1917, more than 150 pieces of sculpture were found in his studio. Most were of wax, clay, and plastiline. Nearly all had reached various stages of deterioration. Illustrations of <em>The Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer</em>, as well as some of the other better-preserved examples were published in the December 1918 issue of <em>La Renaissance de l'Art Fran&ccedil;ais et des Industries de Luxe</em>, the March 1919 issue of <em>Vanity Fair</em>, and the July&#150;August 1919 issue of <em>Art et D&eacute;coration</em>. The debate about their preservation and ultimate disposition began. Degas' heirs were in disagreement about a great many things, but by 1918 they had decided to authorize a series of casts, or editions, of bronzes to be made from seventy-two of the small figures. Albert Bartholom&eacute; (1848&#150;1928), a sculptor and Degas' longtime friend, was to prepare the figures for casting, to be executed by the Paris foundry of A.-A. H&eacute;brard et Cie.</p><p>The contract, dated May 13, 1918, stipulated that each edition would be limited to twenty casts, plus one for Adrien H&eacute;brard (1865&#150;1937), head of the foundry, and one for Degas' heirs. All the bronzes were to be stamped <em>Degas</em>, and a method of marking the individual casts was outlined, but it was not, in fact, the one actually used. Instead, as the catalogue for the first exhibition of the bronzes in Paris (1921) stated, each sculpture was assigned a number (1&#150;73, although in actual practice, 73, <em>The Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer</em>, was not numbered), and each series of casts assigned a letter (A&#150;T). For example, the <em>Dancer Looking at the Sole of Her Right Foot</em> (29.100.377</a>) was given the number 40 in the series and, as the first cast of the figure, the letter A. The completed bronze thus bears the inscribed identification 40/A in addition to the stamp <em>Degas</em> and the seal of the founder (CIRE/PERDUE/A.-A.HEBRARD) within a rectangle. The series cast for the Degas family was to be marked HER.D, and the series cast for H&eacute;brard, HER. Despite some puzzling evidence to the contrary, this system seems to have been followed by H&eacute;brard.</p><p>The actual casting of the bronzes was chiefly the work of one of H&eacute;brard's employees, Albino Palazzolo (1883&#150;1973), who was entrusted with the difficult process of making molds of the delicate original sculptures without destroying them. The molds were then used to cast master models in bronze, and these in turn were used to make the molds necessary for casting the individual waxes for the lost-wax casting of each in an edition of twenty-two bronzes.</p><p><em>The Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer</em> had a somewhat different casting history. It is not certain how many casts were made in bronze, but it has been proposed that the master model from which the bronzes were cast is, in fact, made of plaster, not bronze (Joslyn Art Museum, Omaha, Nebraska).</p><p>The first, or A-letter, series of bronzes was completed before May 1921, when it was exhibited in Paris. The series was bought by Louisine Havemeyer and exhibited in New York in 1922 at the Grolier Club. All but two bronzes in the series are now in the Metropolitan Museum. Another one of the original sculptures, <em>The Schoolgirl</em>, was omitted from the initial series of editions. It, too, had a separate casting history.</p><p>The original sculptures, mostly of wax and long thought to have been destroyed, had in fact been preserved by H&eacute;brard. They came to light in 1955 when they appeared in New York at Knoedler and Company, where they were offered for sale. The master models, which were completely unknown until 1955 when Palazzolo revealed their existence and explained their function, began appearing on the market in the early 1970s. The majority of the original sculptures (four had been destroyed) used for casting were acquired by Paul Mellon, and most of them were ultimately given to the National Gallery in Washington D.C. Three were given to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, England, and four to the Mus&eacute;e du Louvre in Paris (now in the Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay, Paris). The master models were bought by Norton Simon and can be seen today in the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, California.</p><p>Most Degas scholars agree that the original sculptures were not created as aids to painting. With few exceptions, establishing the dates of the originals is therefore quite difficult. Some scholars have assumed that the figures with more highly finished surfaces represent Degas' last versions of the sculptures; another has proposed that the more expansive the movement expressed in the sculpture, the later in Degas' life a sculpture is likely to have been modeled. But there are few documents and little general agreement.</p><p>We know, from the date of one of Muybridge's photographs, that <em>Horse Trotting, the Feet Not Touching the Ground</em> cannot be earlier than 1878 and that <em>The Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer</em> was exhibited in 1881 after having been withdrawn from exhibition a year earlier, presumably because it was then unfinished. In a letter dated June 13, 1889, Degas described his current efforts at creating a base for the work now identified as <em>The Tub</em>. We know also that around 1900, Degas permitted one of the sculptures now titled <em>Dancer Looking at the Sole of Her Right Foot</em> to be cast in plaster. The figure is believed by some to have been made some ten or fifteen years earlier.</p><p>A much larger number of the sculptures relate to paintings, pastels, or drawings</a> with established dates or that can be dated with some degree of certainty. These include the <em>Horse at Trough</em>, recognizable in a painting dated as early as 1866 or 1868; the two figures titled <em>Spanish Dance</em>, which are related to drawings reproduced in 1884; and <em>Dancer in the Role of Harlequin</em>, which has been identified as the sculptural equivalent of a figure dressed as Harlequin in a pastel dated 1885. Many of the poses of the sculptured bathers can also be found among the artist's works on paper, thus permitting us to date this group after the early 1880s with a fair degree of certainty. While these works of art assist in dating the sculpture, most of them cannot be considered definitive evidence, for in a letter of 1910, one of Degas' models described her recent difficulty in holding a pose that was identical to the one preserved in the plaster cast of <em>Dancer Looking at the Sole of Her Right Foot</em> (ca. 1900).</p><p>The original sculptures are quite fragile, owing in part to their media, in part to the fact that the artist's armatures were often inadequate, and in part to Degas' changes of mind. Further, it is known that Bartholom&eacute; prepared the sculpture for the foundry. Comparison of the bronzes with photographs of the original sculptures published in 1918&#150;19 shows that Bartholom&eacute; did make some repairs and changes during the preparation. With the exception of <em>The Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer</em>, however, Bartholom&eacute; and H&eacute;brard, the founder, seem to have been quite scrupulous in reproducing the originals. Some of the bronzes are complete, in both form and detail. Others, like the <em>Horse with Head Lowered</em> (29.100.430</a>), with an exposed armature in the right front leg, must have been left as they were found and reflect an accident to the original sculpture. Still others, dancers with hands left unfinished, or horses without hooves, probably record Degas' diminished interest in a work once he had solved a problem that preoccupied him.</p><p><em>Woman Getting Out of the Bath</em> is now missing arms and feet and has a ravaged chest. Usually considered a fragment, this sculpture may have been intended as a partial figure, an advanced conception for the time. Perhaps the state in which <em>Woman Getting Out of the Bath</em> was preserved is, indeed, the one that Degas intended; perhaps not. We do know, however, that Degas gave permission for another partial figure, now titled <em>Woman Rubbing Her Back with a Sponge</em>, to be cast in plaster during his lifetime, and that he surely knew of such works as <em>Iris, Messenger of the Gods</em> and <em>The Walking Man</em>, both partial figures that Auguste Rodin</a> exhibited as completed sculptures in his pavilion on the Place de l'Alma in 1900, erected concurrently with the Paris Exposition Universelle of that year.</p><p>The titles of the Degas sculptures are, for the most part, English translations of the French names assigned to them at the time of the exhibition of the first series of bronzes in Paris at the Galerie A.-A. H&eacute;brard in 1921. Some have since been revised, reflecting a better understanding of ballet terminology or more accurate identifications of the sculpture's original context.</P>

<a id="heilbrunnLink6" href="#"><strong>&Eacute;douard Manet (1832&ndash;1883)</strong></a></br>
<div id="heilbrunn6">

<P><P>&Eacute;douard Manet&#151;the eldest son of an official in the French Ministry of Justice&#151;had early hopes of becoming a naval officer. After twice failing the training school's entrance exam, the teenager instead went to Paris to pursue a career in the arts. There he studied with Thomas Couture and diligently copied works at the Mus&eacute;e du Louvre.</p><p>The biennial (and later, annual) Parisian Salons</a> were considered the most expedient way for an artist to make himself known to the public, and Manet submitted paintings to Salon juries throughout his career. In 1861, at the age of twenty-nine, he was awarded the Salon's honorable mention for <em>The Spanish Singer</em> (49.58.2</a>). His hopes for continued early success were dashed at the subsequent Salon of 1863. That year, more than half of the submissions to the official Salon were rejected, including Manet's own. To staunch public outcry, Napoleon III ordered the formation of a Salon des Refus&eacute;s. Manet exhibited three paintings, including the scandalous <em>D&eacute;jeuner sur l'herbe</em> (Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay, Paris). The public professed to be shocked by the subject of a nude woman blithely enjoying a picnic in the company of two fully clothed men, while a second, scantily clad woman bathes in a stream. While critics recognized that this scene of modern-day debauchery was, to a certain degree, an updated version of Titian's <em>Concert champ&ecirc;tre</em> (a work then thought to be by Giorgione; Mus&eacute;e du Louvre, Paris), they ruthlessly attacked Manet's painting style.</P></P>



		<p><P>Manet's submissions to the Salon of 1864 were again condemned by critics, who found errors of perspective in his <em>Incident at a Bullfight</em> (fragments of which are now at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., and the Frick Collection, New York) and a lack of decorum in <em>The Dead Christ and the Angels</em> (29.100.51</a>). The latter picture, in particular, was denounced for its realistic touches, such as the cadaverous body of Christ and the seemingly human angels. It was argued that the painting lacked any sense of spirituality; the figure of the battered Christ was said to more closely resemble the body of a dead coal miner than the son of God.</p><p>Despite his efforts, Manet's modern scenes remained a target of criticism throughout the decade. <em>Olympia</em> (Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay, Paris) was considered the most shocking work in the 1865 Salon. Its debt to Titian</a>'s <em>Venus of Urbino</em> (Gallerie degli Uffizi, Florence) only accentuated the wide gulf of public opinion vis-&agrave;-vis a reclining nude woman as subject matter: a goddess was perfectly acceptable, but a contemporary prostitute awaiting her client was not.</p><p>Dejected by the critical response to his art, Manet traveled to Spain in August 1865. His interest in Spanish culture already had been apparent for years, with paintings such as <em>The Spanish Singer</em>, <em>Mademoiselle V&#133;</em>, and <em>Young Man in the Costume of a Majo</em>. He garbed his studio models in Andalusian costumes and outfitted them with Spanish props, often in fanciful ways. For example, the left-handed model of <em>The Spanish Singer</em> (49.58.2</a>) presses on nonexistent chords of a guitar</a> strung for a right-handed player. A stereotypical Spanish still life rests next to his espadrille-clad feet. Similarly, Victorine Meurent, the female model of <em>Mademoiselle V&#133;</em> (29.100.53</a>), is shown wearing men's clothes, as well as shoes that are impractical for a bullfighting ring. Stylistically, many of these paintings reveal a clear debt to the art of Vel&aacute;zquez</a> and Goya</a>.</p><p>After being rejected from the Salon of 1866 and learning that he was to be excluded from the Exposition Universelle of 1867 as well, Manet grew anxious to find an audience for his art. He used his inheritance to construct a pavilion across the street from one of the entrances to the Exposition Universelle. Inside were fifty of his pictures, including several large works now in the Metropolitan's collection: <em>A Matador</em> (29.100.52</a>) and <em>Young Lady in 1866 (Woman with a Parrot)</em> (89.21.3</a>). Earlier that year, the artist's first champion, &Eacute;mile Zola, had published a lengthy and glowing article about Manet. "The future is his," Zola proclaimed. He insisted that the much-maligned <em>D&eacute;jeuner sur l'herbe</em> (which was included in Manet's 1867 exhibition) would one day hang in the Louvre. Zola proved prophetic; it took almost seventy years, but the painting entered the collection of the Louvre (now Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay) in 1934.</p><p>By all accounts, the sociable Manet was on good terms with many of his peers. He had met Edgar Degas</a> in 1859, when they both copied paintings at the Louvre; he befriended Berthe Morisot, who eventually married his younger brother; and he spoke with countless others during the now-famous evening gatherings at the Caf&eacute; Guerbois. His first encounter with Claude Monet</a> was strained due to Manet's belief that Monet was copying his style in "despicable pastiches," then signing them with a signature too close to Manet's own. After the confusion was cleared, the men became close, as is obvious in a work such as <em>The Monet Family</em> (1976.201.14</a>). <em>Boating</em> (29.100.115</a>), also painted during the summer of 1874, records a moment when Manet, Monet, and Auguste Renoir painted together at Argenteuil, a suburb northwest of Paris. That spring, Degas, Monet, and Morisot were among the artists who exhibited together as the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Anonyme des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs (an event more commonly referred to as the first Impressionist</a> exhibition). Manet declined invitations to participate in this or any of the seven subsequent exhibitions organized by the group. They nonetheless influenced one another and shared an interest in modern subjects, plein-air painting, bright colors (often purchased ready-made, in tube form), and visually arresting cropping (inspired by both photographs and Japanese prints</a>).</p><p>When Manet's health began to deteriorate toward the end of the decade, he was advised to take a cure at Bellevue. In the summer of 1880, he rented a villa</a> in that Parisian suburb, and he painted his last portrait of his wife, the Dutch-born pianist Suzanne Leenhoff, in the villa's garden (1997.391.4</a>). The following spring, he won a second-class medal at the Salon for his portrait of Henri Rochefort (Kunsthalle, Hamburg), and in the fall he was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. He continued to work until his premature death in April 1883.</p><p>Within a year, a posthumous exhibition of 179 of his paintings, pastels, drawings, and prints was organized at the &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts, the officially sanctioned art school. At least one critic commented on the irony of the location for an artist whose works had been ridiculed and refused by so many Salon juries. It seems unlikely that Manet would have minded. He himself wrote that he had "no intention of overthrowing old methods of painting, or creating new ones." The critic Louis Gonse viewed things slightly differently. "Manet is a point of departure, the symptomatic precursor of a revolution," he wrote. To this day, Manet is still considered by many art historians to be the father of modernism.</P>

<a id="heilbrunnLink7" href="#"><strong>Lithography in the Nineteenth Century</strong></a></br>
<div id="heilbrunn7">

<P><P>Lithography was invented around 1796 in Germany by an otherwise unknown Bavarian playwright, Alois Senefelder, who accidentally discovered that he could duplicate his scripts by writing them in greasy crayon on slabs of limestone and then printing them with rolled-on ink. Because the local limestone retained so relentlessly any crayon marks applied to its surface, even after repeated inking and printing, lithographs (so called from the Latin for stone, <em>litho</em>, and mark, <em>graph</em>) could be printed in almost unlimited quantities.</P></P>



		<p><P>Thanks to ease of production and economical distribution, it did not take long for lithography to find a broad range of applications in art and commerce. As a means of multiplying drawings, it was embraced by portraitists and illustrators, especially those associated with the popular press (22.63.7</a>; 63.550.266</a>), and it proved an effective means of graphic invention for many of the period's greatest artists (20.17.2</a>).</p><p>Early in the century, Romantic painters</a> such as Th&eacute;odore Gericault (22.63.28</a>) and Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix (17.12</a>) came to appreciate the shifts of tone that could be achieved with lithography: stirring, dramatic effects like those produced with charcoal or black chalk. Some of the Impressionists</a> used the medium to capture fugitive effects of weather or light. James McNeill Whistler</a>, an American who made his career in Europe, used the medium to capture the subtle grays of a seascape veiled in fog (17.3.159</a>), and Edgar Degas</a> (19.29.3</a>) explored the varied forms of natural and artificial lighting at night. Near the end of the nineteenth century, similarly artful manipulations of black and white characterized the work of Symbolists searching for the means to evoke the world of dreams and the unconscious (20.30.6</a>).<br /><br />When improvements in printing technology made it possible to add color to lithography and increase the size of the printing base, commercial possibilities ballooned. Advertising was revolutionized in the 1880s and 1890s by the production of bright mural posters (32.88.12</a>) and art collectors began to enjoy a greater range of offerings in color prints and illustrated books (1970.713</a>).</P>

<a id="heilbrunnLink8" href="#"><strong>Japonisme</strong></a></br>
<div id="heilbrunn8">

<P><P>After Japanese ports reopened to trade with the West in 1853, a tidal wave of foreign imports flooded European shores. On the crest of that wave were woodcut prints by masters of the <em>ukiyo-e</em> school</A> which transformed Impressionist</A> and Post-Impressionist</a> art by demonstrating that simple, transitory, everyday subjects from "the floating world" could be presented in appealingly decorative ways.


		<p><P>It is said that James Whistler</a> discovered Japanese prints in a Chinese tearoom near London Bridge and that Claude Monet</a> first came upon them used as wrapping paper in a spice shop in Holland. James Tissot and his friend Edgar Degas</a> (29.100.127</a>) were among the earliest collectors of Japanese art in France, but their own art was affected by exotic things in very different ways. Unlike Tissot, and others who came under the spell of Japan, Degas avoided staging <em>japoneries</em> that featured models dressed in kimonos and the conspicuous display of oriental props. Instead, he absorbed qualities of the Japanese aesthetic that he found most sympathetic (1975.268.48</a>): elongated pictorial formats, asymmetrical compositions, aerial perspective, spaces emptied of all but abstract elements of color and line, and a focus on singularly decorative motifs. In the process, he redoubled his originality.<br /><br />Degas' American friend Mary Cassatt</a> (16.2.5</a>), who declared that she "hated conventional art," found in Japanese woodcuts like those of Utamaro (JP1278</a>) a fresh approach to the depiction of common events in women's lives. After visiting a large exhibition of <em>ukiyo-e</em> prints at the &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris during the spring of 1890, she produced a set of ten color etchings in open admiration of their subjects, compositions, and technical innovations.<br /><br />Experimentation with a wide range of pictorial modes, and with printmaking techniques</a> as well, coincided with the growing popularity of Japanese woodcuts during the 1890s. Toulouse-Lautrec</a> (41.12.18</a>) adopted the exaggerated colors, contours, and facial expressions found in Kabuki theater prints (JP2822</a>) in order to create his eye-catching posters. Meanwhile, Pierre Bonnard</a> (28.50.4.3</a>) and &Eacute;douard Vuillard (25.70.23</A>), who called themselves "Nabis</a>" or "prophets" of a new style of art, relied upon the piquant, unusual viewpoints of <em>ukiyo-e</em> printmakers (JP804</a>; JP2519</a>) for inspiration. Only Paul Gauguin</a> (36.6.4</a>), who was attracted to the native arts of many cultures, sidestepped the then-current practice of lithography</a> and adapted Japanese woodcut techniques (JP1589</a>) to the abstract expression of his forward-looking art.</P>

<a id="heilbrunnLink9" href="#"><strong>Impressionism: Art and Modernity</strong></a></br>
<div id="heilbrunn9">

<P><P>In 1874, a group of artists called the Anonymous Society of Painters, Sculptors, Printmakers, etc. organized an exhibition in Paris that launched the movement called Impressionism. Its founding members included Claude Monet</a>, Edgar Degas</a>, and Camille Pissarro, among others. The group was unified only by its independence from the official annual Salon</a>, for which a jury of artists from the Acad&eacute;mie des Beaux-Arts selected artworks and awarded medals. The independent artists, despite their diverse approaches to painting, appeared to contemporaries as a group. While conservative critics panned their work for its unfinished, sketchlike appearance, more progressive writers praised it for its depiction of modern life. Edmond Duranty, for example, in his 1876 essay <em>La Nouvelle Peinture</em> (The New Painting), wrote of their depiction of contemporary subject matter in a suitably innovative style as a revolution in painting. The exhibiting collective avoided choosing a title that would imply a unified movement or school, although some of them subsequently adopted the name by which they would eventually be known, the Impressionists. Their work is recognized today for its modernity, embodied in its rejection of established styles, its incorporation of new technology and ideas, and its depiction of modern life.</P></P>



		<p><P>Claude Monet's <em>Impression, Sunrise</em></a> (Mus&eacute;e Marmottan Monet, Paris) exhibited in 1874, gave the Impressionist movement its name when the critic Louis Leroy accused it of being a sketch or "impression," not a finished painting. It demonstrates the techniques many of the independent artists adopted: short, broken brushstrokes that barely convey forms, pure unblended colors, and an emphasis on the effects of light. Rather than neutral white, grays, and blacks, Impressionists often rendered shadows and highlights in color. The artists' loose brushwork gives an effect of spontaneity and effortlessness that masks their often carefully constructed compositions, such as in Alfred Sisley's 1878 <em>All&eacute;e of Chestnut Trees</em> (1975.1.211</A>). This seemingly casual style became widely accepted, even in the official Salon, as the new language with which to depict modern life.<br /><br />In addition to their radical technique, the bright colors of Impressionist canvases were shocking for eyes accustomed to the more sober colors of Academic painting. Many of the independent artists chose not to apply the thick golden varnish that painters customarily used to tone down their works. The paints themselves were more vivid as well. The nineteenth century saw the development of synthetic pigments for artists' paints, providing vibrant shades of blue, green, and yellow that painters had never used before. &Eacute;douard Manet's</a> 1874 <em>Boating</em> (29.100.115</a>), for example, features an expanse of the new Cerulean blue and synthetic ultramarine. Depicted in a radically cropped, Japanese-inspired composition</A>, the fashionable boater and his companion embody modernity in their form, their subject matter, and the very materials used to paint them.<br /><br />Such images of suburban and rural leisure outside of Paris were a popular subject for the Impressionists, notably Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir</a>. Several of them lived in the country for part or all of the year. New railway lines radiating out from the city made travel so convenient that Parisians virtually flooded into the countryside every weekend. While some of the Impressionists, such as Pissarro, focused on the daily life of local villagers in Pontoise, most preferred to depict the vacationers' rural pastimes. The boating and bathing establishments that flourished in these regions became favorite motifs. In his 1869 <em>La Grenouill&egrave;re</em> (29.100.112</a>), for example, Monet's characteristically loose painting style complements the leisure activities he portrays. Landscapes</a>, which figure prominently in Impressionist art, were also brought up to date with innovative compositions, light effects, and use of color. Monet in particular emphasized the modernization of the landscape by including railways and factories, signs of encroaching industrialization that would have seemed inappropriate to the Barbizon artists of the previous generation.<br /><br />Perhaps the prime site of modernity in the late nineteenth century was the city of Paris itself, renovated between 1853 and 1870 under Emperor Napoleon III. His prefect, Baron Haussmann, laid the plans, tearing down old buildings to create more open space for a cleaner, safer city. Also contributing to its new look was the Siege of Paris during the Franco-Prussian War (1870&#150;71), which required reconstructing the parts of the city that had been destroyed. Impressionists such as Pissarro and Gustave Caillebotte enthusiastically painted the renovated city, employing their new style to depict its wide boulevards, public gardens, and grand buildings. While some focused on the cityscapes, others turned their sights to the city's inhabitants. The Paris population explosion after the Franco-Prussian War gave them a tremendous amount of material for their scenes of urban life. Characteristic of these scenes was the mixing of social classes that took place in public settings. Degas and Caillebotte focused on working people, including singers</a> and dancers</A>, as well as workmen. Others, including Berthe Morisot and Mary Cassatt</A>, depicted the privileged classes. The Impressionists also painted new forms of leisure, including theatrical entertainment (such as Cassatt's 1878 <em>In the Loge</a></em> [Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]), caf&eacute;s, popular concerts, and dances. Taking an approach similar to Naturalist writers such as &Eacute;mile Zola, the painters of urban scenes depicted fleeting yet typical moments in the lives of characters they observed. Caillebotte's 1877 <em>Paris Street, Rainy Day</a></em> (Art Institute, Chicago) exemplifies how these artists abandoned sentimental depictions and explicit narratives, adopting instead a detached, objective view that merely suggests what is going on.<br /><br />The independent collective had a fluid membership over the course of the eight exhibitions it organized between 1874 and 1886, with the number of participating artists ranging from nine to thirty. Pissarro, the eldest, was the only artist who exhibited in all eight shows, while Morisot participated in seven. Ideas for an independent exhibition had been discussed as early as 1867, but the Franco-Prussian War intervened. The painter Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Bazille, who had been leading the efforts, was killed in the war. Subsequent exhibitions were headed by different artists. Philosophical and political differences among the artists led to heated disputes and fractures, causing fluctuations in the contributors. The exhibitions even included the works of more conservative artists who simply refused to submit their work to the Salon jury. Also participating in the independent exhibitions were Paul C&eacute;zanne</a> and Paul Gauguin</a>, whose later styles grew out of their early work with the Impressionists.<br /><br />The last of the independent exhibitions in 1886 also saw the beginning of a new phase in avant-garde painting. By this time, few of the participants were working in a recognizably Impressionist manner. Most of the core members were developing new, individual styles that caused ruptures in the group's tenuous unity. Pissarro promoted the participation of Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, in addition to adopting their new technique based on points of pure color, known as Neo-Impressionism</a>. The young Gauguin was making forays into Primitivism. The nascent Symbolist Odilon Redon also contributed, though his style was unlike that of any other participant. Because of the group's stylistic and philosophical fragmentation, and because of the need for assured income, some of the core members such as Monet and Renoir exhibited in venues where their works were more likely to sell.<br /><br />Its many facets and varied participants make the Impressionist movement difficult to define. Indeed, its life seems as fleeting as the light effects it sought to capture. Even so, Impressionism was a movement of enduring consequence, as its embrace of modernity made it the springboard for later avant-garde art</a> in Europe.</P>

<a id="heilbrunnLink10" href="#"><strong>The Lure of Montmartre, 1880&ndash;1900</strong></a></br>
<div id="heilbrunn10">

<P><P>"In this bizarre land swarmed a host of colorful artists, writers, painters, musicians, sculptors, architects, a few with their own places but most in furnished lodgings, surrounded by the workers of Montmartre, the starchy ladies of the rue Br&eacute;da, the retired folk of Batignolles, sprouting up all over the place, like weeds. Montmartre was home to every kind of artist." Penned in 1882 by the writer F&#233;licien Champsaur, these words describe the diverse audience of the Chat Noir, a cabaret that epitomized the raucous and irreverent popular entertainment for which the Parisian neighborhood of Montmartre was known. Artists, intellectuals, and writers flocked to this bohemian district, frequenting its vibrant performance halls and celebrating them in their paintings, literature, and poems. But while Montmartre's popularity as a brash amusement district reached dizzying heights in the 1890s, the area itself had rather humble beginnings.</P></P>



		<p><P>Perched atop a hill to the north of Paris's city center, Montmartre was initially a rural village dotted with vineyards and windmills. The area's picturesque appearance and its views of the metropolis below had long been popular with artists, such as the landscape painter Georges Michel (1763&#150;1843), who captured the area's rustic beauty around 1820 in The Mill of Montmartre (25.110.8</a>). Forty years later, Montmartre would lose its agrarian nature when it was officially annexed into Paris's rapidly expanding city limits. Despite its eventual urbanization, the neighborhood retained its distinct characteristics, such as the old buildings, steep and narrow streets, and rustic windmills, some of which are still in existence today.<br /><br />Montmartre's remote location and inexpensive lodgings contributed to its transformation into a primarily working-class neighborhood in the second half of the nineteenth century. Known for its revolutionary politics and underground culture, its liberal reputation lured students, writers, musicians, and artists to the area in the early 1880s. The more affluent lower slopes, which Vincent van Gogh</a> referred to as the "grands boulevards," housed the apartments and studios of established painters such as Edgar Degas</a> (1834&#150;1917), Auguste Renoir</a> (1841&#150;1919), and Gustave Moreau (1826&#150;1898). This locale was also home to art supply vendors and several important art dealers and galleries, such as Georges Petit, Paul Durand-Ruel, and Goupil &amp; Cie.<br /><br />Rents dropped steadily as one mounted the precarious streets to the top of the hill, called the "butte," and the population became increasingly working class. It was in this area&#151;Van Gogh's "petits boulevards"&#151;that young avant-garde artists such as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec</a> (1864&#150;1901), Vincent van Gogh (1853&#150;1890), &#201;mile Bernard (1868&#150;1941), and Louis Anquetin (1861&#150;1932) lived and worked. A long-established center of local amusement, the "butte" featured working-class dance halls such as the Moulin de la Galette, whose iconic double windmills became the first architectural symbol of Montmartre's bohemian culture. The Moulin de la Galette became a popular subject at the fin-de-si&#232;cle and was painted by, among others, Renoir and the visiting Catalan painters Pablo Picasso</a> (1881&#150;1973), Santiago Rusin&#245;l (1861&#150;1931), and Ram&#243;n Casas (1866&#150;1932).<br /><br />Replacing the Latin Quarter as the locus of the city's intellectual and artistic community, Montmartre boasted a thriving bohemian culture that was driven by its critique of decadent society. Its raucous caf&#233;-concerts and cabarets featured satires and crude, often subversive, performances that mocked the Third Republic's bourgeois morality and increasingly corrupt politics. Cabarets and caf&#233;-concerts were favorite spots for avant-garde artists such as Degas, who sought to capture their celebrated performers, hazy atmospheres, and artificial stage lighting in his paintings, pastels, and prints (61.101.7</a>; 19.29.3</a>).<br /><br />By the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the appeal of the cabarets and caf&#233;-concerts extended well beyond the borders of Montmartre. Its performance halls provided a rare opportunity for the mixing of social classes, particularly between bourgeois men and working-class women, whose interactions were often based on prostitution. The blurring of class boundaries contributed to Montmartre's reputation as a place for escape, pleasure, entertainment, and sexual freedom. Nowhere was this more evident than in its numerous dance halls, whose popularity reached a zenith with the opening of the Moulin Rouge in 1889.<br /><br />Strategically located on the class divide at the bottom of the "butte," the Moulin Rouge offered a wide range of entertainments to attract a more upscale clientele, from clowns (49.55.50), acrobats, and tightrope walkers to singers and donkey rides in its outdoor garden. The dance floor featured local stars performing the latest crazes, such as the particularly erotic version of the popular cancan called <em>le chahut</em>. In the 1880s and 1890s, artists would immortalize this famous dance in works such as Georges Seurat's</a> <em>Le Chahut</em> (1889&#150;90; Kr&#246;ller-M&#252;ller Museum), in which his innovative pointillist technique expresses the modernity of his subject.<br /><br />Toulouse-Lautrec was particularly drawn to the diversity of the dance hall's audience, relying on recognizable Monmartrois types&#151;the cancan dancer, the young working-class woman, the bourgeois man&#151;to convey both the sexual freedom and the spectacle associated with the quarter. Combining commercial advertising techniques with avant-garde compositions characterized by cut-off angles, simplified silhouettes, and flat areas of pure color, he created bold and vivid lithographs of Montmartre's most celebrated performers (32.88.17; 32.88.15).<br /><br />His first commercial poster, <em>Moulin Rouge: La Goulue</em> (1891; 32.88.12</a>), contrasts the seductive performance of La Goulue (The Glutton), one of the dance hall's most famous stars, with an anonymous, predominantly male audience identifiable as middle class by the ubiquitous top hat. Such sexually suggestive images&#151;a direct result of the loosening of censorship laws in 1881&#151;created a sensation with the Parisian public as they both assaulted bourgeois morals and transformed Montmartre's working-class performers into overnight celebrities.<br /><br />Toulouse-Lautrec's interest in Montmartre culture was not limited to advertisements, however, and he became the first artist to dedicate large-scale canvases to the seedier aspects of its nightlife. Employing methods of caricature with a rapid execution, he exposed the artificiality, anxiety, and social tension that characterized fin-de-si&#232;cle Parisian society in paintings such as <em>At the Moulin Rouge</em> (1892/95; Art Institute of Chicago) and <em>The Englishman at the Moulin Rouge</em> (1892; 67.187.108</a>).<br /><br />The 1880s and 1890s also witnessed the rise in popularity of the circus, which was considered to be a form of artistic expression. Like the dance hall, the circus offered its audience both visual and physical spectacles, and its performers became favored subjects among modern artists, for example Seurat's <em>Circus Sideshow</em> (1887&#150;88; 61.101.17</a>) and the <em>Harlequin</em> by Pablo Picasso (1901; 60.87</a>). The connection between the entertainments offered in both the dance hall and the circus tent is underscored by Toulouse-Lautrec's <em>Equestrienne (At the Circus Fernando)</em> (1887&#150;88; Art Institute of Chicago), a sexually charged image that was purchased to decorate the Moulin Rouge.<br /><br />By the time of the World's Fair held in Paris in 1900, Montmartre had developed into a veritable entertainment industry, boasting over forty venues comprised of cabarets, caf&#233;-concerts, dance halls, music halls, theaters, and circuses. The area's underground bohemian culture had become a part of mainstream bourgeois entertainment through the rapid commercialization and marketing of its venues and performers. As a result, Toulouse-Lautrec and his avant-garde contemporaries lost interest in Montmartre's nightlife and sought their modern subjects elsewhere. What had begun as a critique of decadent society had become a symbol of decadence itself.</P>

<a id="heilbrunnLink11" href="#"><strong>The Salon and The Royal Academy</strong></a></br>
<div id="heilbrunn11">

<P><P>The most significant professional art societies in Europe in the nineteenth century were the Royal Academies of Art in France and England, established in 1648 and 1768 respectively. They ran schools of instruction, held annual or semi-annual exhibitions, and provided venues where artists could display their work and cultivate critical notice. Here, young artists could find themselves promoted to prominence through patronage connections and collectively seek protection of artistic interests. From the late eighteenth century, as dominated by Jacques Louis David</a> (31.45</a>) in France and Sir Joshua Reynolds (20.155.3</a>) in England, such institutions had a virtual monopoly on public taste and official patronage. Academic art, whose standard was ancient classical art, the European tradition, and historical subjects (2009.423</a>) rendered predominantly in painting and sculpture, retained sway through the nineteenth century, and was sustained by its presence at the world's fairs that proliferated in the West from the 1850s.</P></P>



		<p><P>However, by the mid-nineteenth century, academies across Europe were undercut by what would later be seen as avant-garde movements. Some artists sought change from within, exhibiting their radical works at these official venues. In many cases, the Academies showed a rather enlightened openness to the institutional critique offered by the Pre-Raphaelites</A> in England, or the Realists</a> in France represented by Gustave Courbet (40.175</a>), Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Millet, and &Eacute;douard Manet</a> (29.100.51</a>), and repeatedly accepted their works for exhibition. By the later nineteenth century, alternate exhibition venues challenged their hegemony. The Grosvenor Gallery on New Bond Street in London (1877&#150;90) was where Edward Burne-Jones showed his majestic Aestheticist painting, <em>The Love Song</em> (47.26</A>), along with eight other works in 1878. In Paris, the first of the eight Impressionist</A> exhibitions, initially called the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Anonyme des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs, etc., was held from April 15 to May 15, 1874, at 35 boulevard des Capucines, in the former studios of the photographer Nadar</A>. While artists in England, like Frederic Leighton and George Frederick Watts, simultaneously showed at the Royal Academy (RA) and the Grosvenor Gallery, in France the Impressionist exhibit constituted a dissenting and independent gambit&#151;participants were not allowed to submit works to that year's Salon (although this was not such a risk&#151;the Salon jury had rejected most of the submissions by artists like Monet</A> in the late 1860s). Audiences in England were, perhaps, more open to the alternate conceptions of art found at Grosvenor Gallery, and the artists of the Aesthetic movement who showed there found immediate success. By contrast, the first Impressionist exhibition attracted 3,500 visitors, as compared to the 450,000 attendees of the Salon that opened two weeks later.<br /><br />But it is wrong to suggest that advanced art was absent from the RA and Salon walls. J. M. W. Turner</a> showed consistently at the RA in the first half of the century. The Metropolitan's <em>The Grand Canal, Venice</em> (99.31</a>) and <em>Whalers (The Whale Ship)</em> (Tate, London) were exhibited at the 1835 and 1845 shows respectively, the former at Somerset House on the Strand, and the latter at the RA's former home in the East Wing of the building on Trafalgar Square that is now fully occupied by the National Gallery. In 1895, Leighton showed <em>Lachrymae</em> (96.28</A>), one of his final paintings, at Burlington House on Piccadilly, the Academy's address since 1868. The former Pre-Raphaelite John Everett Millais, who would succeed Leighton as the tenth president of the RA in 1896, was the institution's most stalwart defender and greatest product, having entered its schools at the age of ten. However, in 1886, he elected to send <em>Portia</em> (06.1328</a>) to the commercial gallery of the dealer and printer Thomas McLean on the Haymarket. <em>Portia</em> is similar to Leighton's <em>Lachrymae</em> in that both reprise Sir Joshua Reynolds' dictum of the Grand Manner&#151;the study and adaptation of the old masters to enliven portraiture and history painting. Millais painted the real-life thespian Kate Dolan in the role of Shakespeare's rich heiress and barrister from <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>, while Leighton's model was Mary Lloyd, who also posed for his masterpiece <em>Flaming June</em> (1895; Museo de Arte de Ponce) as well as for Millais. While Millais' bravura style and psychological intensity approached that of advanced contemporaries in France, in <em>Lachrymae</em> Leighton hewed to the typical smooth, clean finish of Salon paintings and the continental academic tradition, which he had learned under the Nazarene follower Eduard Jakob von Steinle at the St&auml;delsches Kunstinstitut in Frankfurt in the 1840s and 1850s, and in further study in Paris and Rome (he grew up and lived abroad the first twenty-nine years of his life). But the abstract narrative and depth of loss suggested in the pose and mood, and the surprising impasto in the sunset, is greatly evocative and represents a novel classicism. Leighton's contemporary Gustave Moreau was engaged in a similar resuscitation of traditions in the French Salons.<br /><br />Burne-Jones' <em>The Love Song</em> (47.26</a>), one of the most important Victorian pictures in a U.S. collection, represents a branch of the Aesthetic movement, with its subject derived from no literary source, its dreamy medievalism, and its inspired blend of Gothic and Renaissance prototypes combined with a Pre-Raphaelite intensity of detail and effect. There is a subtle religiosity in the twilight sun shining through the stained-glass windows</A> of the church in the background and falling on the organ pipes. And the contemporary blended conceptions of female and male beauty, as well as literal musicality echoed in the mood, presented both a challenge to traditional historical art and a rarefied transformation of the early concerns of Pre-Raphaelitism.<br /><br />The Frenchman Jules Bastien-Lepage, in his most ambitious picture, <em>Joan of Arc</em> of 1879 (89.21.1</A>), straddled the line between acceptably grand historical and nationalistic themes and the broken brushwork of the avant-garde. The picture was a critical failure despite its topicality: a call to arms for a country who had been soundly bested in the Franco-Prussian War using the perennially inspiring image of the Maid of Orl&eacute;ans, a peasant girl from the very region that Bismarck had wrested from France nine years earlier. At its exhibition in the Salon of 1880, &Eacute;mile Zola castigated the thirty-year-old artist for the seemingly contradictory vision of airy saints in a plein-air milieu. Today, the picture seems a key transition to the aims of later pan-European Symbolism</a>, and one of the supreme achievements in late nineteenth-century Salon painting. It was a particularly prescient purchase by the American Erwin Davis, who paid the artist $4,000 for it and then gave it to the Metropolitan Museum in 1889.<br /><br />A more literal casualty of the Franco-Prussian conflict was the Parisian Henri-Alexandre-Georges Regnault, whose <em>Salom&eacute;</em> (16.95</a>) was begun in Rome, finished in Tangier, and exhibited in the Salon of 1870 mere months before the onset of hostilities, and less than a year before the artist's death on the battlefield at Buzenval. A student of Alexandre Cabanel, Regnault used fabrics bought at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1867 to create his Orientalist</a> picture, an archly humorous and artificial image of a plucky female model, draped in a New Testament tableau, who seems far removed from the more serious and threatening conceptions of Herod's bedeviller in both theater and music of the period.<br /><br />Images of women were dominant in the Salon in the second half of the nineteenth century, in a marked change from the ubiquitous classicized male nudes of Davidian Neoclassicism</a>. These came in the form of pearlescent goddesses, as in Cabanel's <em>The Birth of Venus</em>, shown at the Salon of 1863 and represented in the Museum's collection by a smaller version of 1875 (94.24.1</a>), or Jean-L&eacute;on G&eacute;r&ocirc;me's mythological artistic fantasy <em>Pygmalion and Galatea</em> of around 1890. This is also evident in erotic couples, as in Pierre-Auguste Cot's neo-Rococo melodrama <em>The Storm</em> of 1880 (87.15.134</a>), loosely based&#151;if at all&#151;on Bernardin de Saint-Pierre's Romantic</A> classic <em>Paul et Virginie</em> (1788), but more fully concerned with clinging drapery, lustful glances, and mock heroism than the sublime.<br /><br />Another option was the watered-down Second Empire bourgeois populist realism of Jules Breton, Rosa Bonheur (87.25</a>), and William-Adolphe Bouguereau, evident in the latter's <em>Young Mother Gazing at Her Child</em> and <em>Breton Brother and Sister</em> (87.15.32</a>), both of 1871, where an official style combining a porcelain surface with provincial religious piety replaces the matter-of-fact, direct, and radically composed and painted social commentary of Courbet and Millet. More compelling is Pascal-Adolphe-Jean Dagnan-Bouveret's <em>The Pardon in Brittany</em> shown at the Salon of 1887 (31.132.34</a>) and then at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1889, in which a local Catholic custom involving traditional costume and a procession (<em>le pardon</em>) to receive indulgences is represented with a naturalism and contemporaneity marked by interests in physiognomy, eclectic lighting, and anti-Academic composition. In addition, the artist's direct use of photography in creating his pictures represents a particular aspect of technological advancement that would only gain steam into the next century, and presents a strand of modern painting very distant from that of Impressionism and Aestheticism.<br /><br />Salon art, like Impressionism, was also concerned with the modernity of urban life. While academically trained artists such as James Tissot and Edgar Degas</a> first specialized in historical imagery, they then exclusively concentrated on contemporary life, as in Tissot's <em>Tea</em> of 1872 (1998.170</a>). Similar to Degas' later series of women in millinery shops (29.100.38</a>), Tissot pursues the genteel, but with an active surface that shows his awareness of Impressionist facture, and in the type of domestic subject that Mary Cassatt</a> would depict continuously in succeeding decades (23.101</a>). But from 1871 to 1882, his subject was the English&#151;<em>Tea</em> shows a scene in the port of Gravesend at the mouth of the Thames&#151;and, like John Singer Sargent</a> and James McNeill Whistler</a>, Tissot made the transition from a French to an English artistic and social milieu with great success, and with no small effect on advanced painting of the subsequent generation of European and American artists.<br /><br />In France, by the end of the nineteenth century and the first decade of the twentieth, new Salons were ascendant, including the Salon des Ind&eacute;pendants in the spring and the Salon d'Automne later in the year, which showed the works of modernist artists like Henri Matisse</a> (1975.1.194</A>) and Andr&eacute; Derain. The importance of traditional academies largely waned, but in places like Austria, artists such as Gustav Klimt taught in the venerable Akademie der Bildenden K&uuml;nste in Vienna, preserving its advanced thrust well into the new century.</P>

<a id="heilbrunnLink12" href="#"><strong>Edgar Degas (1834&ndash;1917): Painting and Drawing</strong></a></br>
<div id="heilbrunn12">

<P><P>Edgar Degas seems never to have reconciled himself to the label of &quot;Impressionist</a>,&quot; preferring to call himself a &quot;Realist</a>&quot; or &quot;Independent.&quot; Nevertheless, he was one of the group&#146;s founders, an organizer of its exhibitions, and one of its most important core members. Like the Impressionists, he sought to capture fleeting moments in the flow of modern life, yet he showed little interest in painting <em>plein air</em> landscapes</a>, favoring scenes in theaters and caf&eacute;s illuminated by artificial light, which he used to clarify the contours of his figures, adhering to his Academic training</a>.</P></P>



		<p><P>Degas was born in 1834, the scion of a wealthy banking family, and was educated in the classics, including Latin, Greek, and ancient history, at the Lyc&eacute;e Louis-le-Grand in Paris. His father recognized his son&#146;s artistic gifts early, and encouraged his efforts at drawing by taking him frequently to Paris museums. Degas began by copying Italian Renaissance paintings at the Louvre, and trained in the studio of Louis Lamothe, who taught in the traditional Academic style, with its emphasis on line and its insistence on the crucial importance of draftsmanship. Degas was also strongly influenced by the paintings and frescoes</a> he saw during several long trips to Italy in the late 1850s; he made many sketches and drawings of them in his notebooks.<br /><br />Evidence of Degas&#146;s classical education can be seen in his relatively static, frieze-like early painting, <em>Young Spartans Exercising</em> (ca. 1860; National Gallery, London), done while he was still in his twenties. Yet despite the title, and the suggestion of classical drapery on some of the figures in the background, there is little that places the subject of this painting in ancient Greece. Indeed, it has been noted that the young girls have the snub noses and immature bodies of &quot;Montmartre</a> types,&quot; the forerunners of the dancers Degas painted so often throughout his career. After 1865, when the Salon accepted his history painting <em>The Misfortunes of the City of Orl&eacute;ans</em> (Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay, Paris), Degas did not paint Academic subjects again, focusing his attention on scenes of modern life. He began to paint scenes of such urban leisure activities as horse racing and, after about 1870, of caf&eacute;-concert singers and ballet dancers</a>.<br /><br />Degas&#146;s choice of subject matter reflects his modern approach. He favored scenes of ballet dancers, laundresses, milliners (<em>At the Milliner&#146;s</em>, 1882; 29.100.38</a>), and denizens of Parisian low life. His interest in ballet dancers intensified in the 1870s, and eventually he produced approximately 1,500 works on the subject. These are not traditional portraits, but studies that address the movement of the human body, exploring the physicality and discipline of the dancers through the use of contorted postures and unexpected vantage points. In <em>Dancer Adjusting Her Slipper</em> (1873; 29.100.941</a>), the figure&#146;s pose is difficult to decipher, viewed from a steep angle with both her feet and her head at the bottom of the picture, yet it conveys a sense of the dancer&#146;s flexibility.<br /><br />Degas absorbed artistic tradition and outside influences and reinterpreted them in innovative ways. Following the opening of trade with Japan in 1854, many French artists, including Degas, were increasingly influenced by Japanese prints</a>. But whereas his contemporaries often infused their paintings with Eastern imagery</a>, Degas abstracted from these prints their inventive compositions and points of view, particularly in his use of cropping and asymmetry. Degas had also observed how sixteenth-century Italian Mannerists</a> similarly framed their subjects, sometimes cutting off part of a figure. For example, in <em>A Woman Seated Beside a Vase of Flowers</em> (1865; 29.100.128</a>), the figure is cut off at the right edge of the painting, with part of her left hand just barely visible at the lower right corner. In her subdued attire she seems almost incidental to the riot of color that makes up the central floral arrangement. Unusual vantage points and asymmetrical framing are a consistent theme throughout Degas&#146;s works, especially in his many paintings and pastels</a> of ballet dancers, from the time of <em>Dancers Practicing at the Bar</em> (1877; 29.100.34</a>), through the decades until <em>Dancers, Pink and Green</em> (ca. 1890; 29.100.42</a>), and beyond. Even in a more traditional work of portraiture like the <em>Duchessa di Montejasi with Her Daughters, Elena and Camilla</em> (ca. 1876; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), he achieves a more modern effect by disrupting the compositional balance.<br /><br />Degas had a lively, scientific interest in a wide range of media, including engraving</a>, monotype</a>, and photography</a>. Before 1880, he generally used oils for his completed works (2008.277</a>), which were based on preliminary studies and sketches made in pencil or pastel. But after 1875, he began using pastels more frequently, even in finished works, such as <em>Portraits at the Stock Exchange</em> (1876; 1991.277.1</a>), which displays a subtle grasp of the characteristic postures and attire of the top-hatted gentlemen he portrays. By 1885, most of his more important works were done in pastel. He submitted a suite of nudes, all rendered in pastel, to the final Impressionist exhibition in 1886; among these was <em>Woman Bathing in a Shallow Tub</em> (1885; 29.100.41</a>). The figures in these pastels were criticized for their ungainly poses, as in this work, in which the figure squats awkwardly in a tub, yet the steep perspective gives the work a solid, sculptural balance.<br /><br />Degas experimented with an array of techniques, breaking up surface textures with hatching, contrasting dry pastel with wet, and using gouache and watercolors to soften the contours of his figures. In <em>Race Horses</em> (1885&#150;88; 1999.288.3</a>), which depicts another of Degas&#146;s favorite themes, the use of hatching gives a sense of swaying grass. The immediacy of the moment is captured in the raised leg of the horse in the foreground and the foreshortened, angled approach of the vigorous horse in the background. <em>The Singer in Green</em> (ca. 1884; 61.101.7</a>) demonstrates Degas&#146;s use of pastel to achieve the effect of the glare of footlights illuminating his subject from below and his use of coarse hatching to suggest the curtained backdrop behind the singer.<br /><br />By the late 1880s, Degas&#146;s eyesight had begun to fail, perhaps as a result of an injury suffered during his service in defending Paris during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870&#150;71. After that time he focused almost exclusively on dancers and nudes, increasingly turning to sculpture</a> as his eyesight weakened. In his later years, he was concerned chiefly with showing women bathing, entirely without self-consciousness and emphatically not posed. Despite the seemingly fleeting glimpses he portrayed, he achieved a solidity in his figures that is almost sculptural.<br /><br />In later life, Degas became reclusive, morose, and given to bouts of depression, probably as a consequence of his increasing blindness. His monotype <em>Landscape</em> (1890&#150;92; 1972.636</a>), an unusual work from this period, is an unexpected instance of Degas presenting an outdoor scene with no figures, which shows an imaginative and expressive use of color and freedom of line that may have arisen, at least in part, as a result of his struggle to adapt to his deteriorating vision.<br /><br />Degas continued working as late as 1912, when he was forced to leave the studio in Montmartre in which he had labored for more than twenty years. He died five years later in 1917, at the age of eighty-three.</P>

<a id="heilbrunnLink13" href="#"><strong>France, 1800&ndash;1900 A.D.</strong></a></br>
<div id="heilbrunn13">
<strong>Overview</strong></br>
<P>At the turn of the nineteenth century, France is governed by Napoleon as First Consul. As emperor, Napoleon sanctions the Neoclassical style, embodied in the art of Jacques-Louis David (1748&#150;1825). Meanwhile, the seeds of Romanticism&#151;sown here and elsewhere in Europe by contemporary writers, poets, and philosophers&#151;give rise to an aesthetic that exalts emotion, nature, and the sublime over rationalism and classicism. Around mid-century, in the midst of class struggles and the wake of civil uprisings against an oppressive government, Romanticism is supplanted by Realism in the visual arts and literature, which focuses on modern subjects and the lives of the lower classes.</P>

<P>Two major artistic movements dominate the second half of the century. A group of painters known as the Impressionists</a> also take up themes from modern life, executing primarily landscape and genre subjects with broken color and loose brushwork that reflect the transitory nature of the images they depict. In response, a group of artists known as the Post-Impressionists</a> develop independent styles of painting that reject the objective naturalism of the Impressionists. At the century's close, or <I>fin-de-si&egrave;cle</I>, many artists, designers, and collectors promote an artistic reform leading to a style known as Art Nouveau. Based on asymmetrical, organic forms and influenced by Japanese art</a>, the Art Nouveau</a> style emerges in painting and the graphic arts as well as in architecture and the design</a> of everyday objects.</P>

</br>
<strong>Key Events</strong></br>

				<ul>
<strong><P>&#149; ca. 1800</strong> A faction emerges from the studio of Jacques Louis David</a> (1748&#150;1825). Known as the Primitifs, these artists push the Neoclassical style championed by their master toward a greater simplicity, emulating the linear purity of Greek vase painting</a> and fifteenth-century Italian art.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1801</strong> Architects Charles Percier (1764&#150;1838) and Pierre-Fran&ccedil;ois-L&eacute;onard Fontaine (1762&#150;1853) publish the<I> Recueil de d&eacute;corations int&eacute;rieures</I>, a compilation of drawings of contemporary design that will set the standard for the Empire style of interior decoration, which spreads throughout Europe. The two collaborate on the interior of Jos&eacute;phine Bonaparte's ch&acirc;teau outside of Paris, Malmaison (1800&#150;1802), whose decoration reflects the Imperial Roman models and Egyptian-inspired motifs characteristic of the Empire style</a>.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1804</strong> Antoine-Jean Gros (1771&#150;1835), a student of David, paints the monumental canvas <I>Napoleon in the Plague House at Jaffa</I>. This propagandizing work depicts the general's visit to plague-afflicted prisoners during the siege of Jaffa. Recalling both Christian imagery and the divine touch of kings, Gros depicts Napoleon touching an inmate, who gestures in incredulity. The architectural setting and figures in exotic dress mark an early appearance of Orientalism</a>, a fascination with the Eastern world that is stimulated in part by Napoleon's Egyptian campaign, and that will persist in art throughout the nineteenth century.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1804</strong> Napoleon I Bonaparte (1769&#150;1821) has himself proclaimed emperor of the French. At his coronation on December 2, at the Cathedral of Notre-Dame, Napoleon takes the imperial crown from the hands of Pope Pius VII and places it on his own head. As First Painter to the emperor, Jacques-Louis David portrays the royal splendor of this event in <I>The Coronation of the Emperor Napoleon I and the Crowning of the Empress Jos&eacute;phine</I> (1805&#150;7; Mus&eacute;e du Louvre, Paris), and produces other iconic images of Napoleon, including a depiction of the general as he signals to lead his troops across the Alps in a campaign that will vanquish his Austrian foes (<I>Napoleon Crossing the Alps</I>, 1800; Mus&eacute;e National de Malmaison). This mounted equestrian portrait recalls, in its format and pose, sculpted memorials to the heroes of antiquity (in fact, Napoleon crossed the Alps riding a mule).</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1806</strong> Antonio Canova (1757&#150;1822), praised as the greatest sculptor of the age, executes a large-scale classical nude figure of Napoleon as a benevolent Mars. Canova produces portraits of other members of the emperor's family, including the idealized reclining nude</a> figure of Pauline Borghese, Napoleon's sister, in the guise of Venus (1808; Galleria Borghese, Rome).</li>

<strong><P>&#149; 1814</strong> The Allied armies of Britain, Russia, and Austria enter Paris. Napoleon abdicates and is exiled to Elba, and Louis XVIII (r. 1814&#150;24) ascends the throne, establishing a constitutional monarchy. The Congress of Vienna meets between September 1814 and June 1815 with the aim of restructuring the European continent, nearly all of which has been taken as the spoils of Napoleon's military campaigns. In the following year, Napoleon escapes from exile and returns to power for a brief period known as the "Hundred Days." He is finally defeated by Allied forces under the Duke of Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo (1815), and exiled to Saint Helena, where he dies in 1821.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1816</strong> The French government frigate <I>Medusa</I> founders off the coast of Africa; the ship's captain abandons 150 passengers on a makeshift raft, of whom only fifteen survive after thirteen days at sea. Th&eacute;odore Gericault (1791&#150;1824) depicts this controversial subject with chilling explicitness in <I>The Raft of the Medusa </I>(1818&#150;19; Louvre), a triumph of early Romantic painting in its description of human anguish and the futile struggle of man against nature.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1824</strong> In a pivotal year for the development of French painting, works by contemporary British painters such as landscapist John Constable (1776&#150;1837) are exhibited at the Salon, along with Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix's (1798&#150;1863) <I>Massacre at Chios </I>(Louvre). Though met with mixed reviews, the canvas becomes an icon of the emerging Romantic aesthetic in French painting. In the same year, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (1780&#150;1867) returns to France after an eighteen-year sojourn in Italy. The two artists&#151;one the great proponent of French Romantic painting, the other a staunch exponent of Davidian classicism&#151;are posited in a stylistic rivalry, lasting until mid-century, that recalls that of the <I>poussinistes</I> and <I>rub&eacute;nistes</I> of a century earlier: Ingres' art asserts the supremacy of academic tradition, linear contour, and design, while that of Delacroix counters with freer brushwork, often-turbulent compositions, and sensuous colorism.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1830</strong> The July Revolution, an uprising stirred by and among the middle classes, rages for three days in reaction against attempts by King Charles X (r. 1824&#150;30) to return to the absolutist monarchy of the ancien r&eacute;gime. Charles abdicates and flees; despite the citizens' clamor for a republic, the duc d'Orl&eacute;ans is proclaimed limited constitutional monarch as Louis-Philippe. In this year, Delacroix paints <I>Liberty Leading the People</I> (Louvre), combining realism and allegory in a depiction of the personification of Liberty bearing a tricolor and leading combatants through a corpse-littered barricade. Louis-Philippe himself acquires the work when it is shown at the Salon of 1831.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; ca. 1830&#150;70</strong> The Barbizon School</a> of landscape painting</a> flourishes in the region of the French village from which it takes its name. Influenced by seventeenth-century Dutch masters, the Barbizon painters turn away from idealized classical landscapes in favor of direct observation of nature and sketching out-of-doors, <I>en plein air</I> (a practice facilitated by the introduction, in 1841, of collapsible metal squeeze tubes of paint). Central figures of this school are Th&eacute;odore Rousseau (1812&#150;1867), Jules Dupr&eacute; (1811&#150;1889), and Charles Daubigny (1817&#150;1878). In 1849, Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Millet (1814&#150;1875) settles in Barbizon, where he paints <I>The Gleaners</I> (1857), <I>The Angelus</I> (1859; both Louvre), and other works that endow peasant life with a monumental dignity.</li>

<strong><P>&#149; 1831</strong> Sculptor Antoine-Louis Barye (1796&#150;1875) submits a plaster model to the Salon&#151;<I>Tiger Devouring a Gavial of the Ganges</I>&#151;winning public acclaim. Best known for animal groups such as this, Barye appeals to a contemporary taste for unflinching images of nature at its most ferocious.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1834</strong> Auguste Pr&eacute;ault (1809&#150;1879) exhibits the plaster relief panel <I>Tuerie (Slaughter)</I> at the Salon. Its fragmented figures contort into gestures of anguish, their mouths opened to cry out. The emphasis on physical and emotional extremes, a radical departure from the conventions of classical relief, marks Pr&eacute;ault's vanguard approach.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1836</strong> The Arc de Triomphe is unveiled at the Place d'&Eacute;toile in Paris. Begun in 1806 by Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois-Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Chalgrin (1739&#150;1811), the triumphal arch is conceived as an emblem of Napoleonic rule inspired by ancient Roman models. Louis-Philippe fosters its completion by architects L. Goust, Jean-Nicolas Huyot, and Guillaume-Abel Blouet, with a revised decorative program celebrating French patriotism. Among the various participants in its decoration is Fran&ccedil;ois Rude (1784&#150;1855), who executes one of four sculptural groups flanking the arch's opening, <I>The Departure of the Volunteers of 1792</I>, better known as <I>La Marseillaise</I>. The work elevates the volunteer soldiers to the status of mythic heroes as they advance&#151;nude, or wearing classical armor&#151;under the sweeping winged allegorical figure of Liberty.</li>

<strong><P>&#149; 1839</strong> Louis-Jacques-Mand&eacute; Daguerre (1787&#150;1851) exhibits a photographic image, produced on a silver-coated copper plate with iodine vapors, which he calls the daguerreotype. His collaborator for six years (from 1827) is Nic&eacute;phore Ni&eacute;pce (1765&#150;1833), the French chemist who in 1816 produces the first negative and, in 1826, the earliest surviving photographic image.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1842 onward</strong> Major excavations in northern Iraq, then part of the Ottoman Turkish empire, are undertaken by French and British diplomats and adventurers. Many of the monumental stone sculptures and reliefs discovered within ancient Assyrian royal palaces (dating from the ninth to seventh century <span class="timeCap">B.C.</span>) are shipped to London and Paris, prompting a vogue for all things Assyrian. Many architects and artists are influenced by the discoveries and an Assyrian Revival</a> style flourishes in the second half of the nineteenth and early twentieth century.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1848</strong> The February Revolution overthrows Orl&eacute;ans rule and establishes the Second Republic. In late June of this year, class riots break out in the working districts of Paris and are brutally suppressed by the army. The "Year of Revolutions" has a profound effect on contemporary artists such as Ernest Meissonier (1815&#150;1891), who depicts the tragic casualties of the uprising in <I>Memory of Civil War</I> (Louvre), shown at the Salon of 1850&#150;51.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1849</strong> On an official mission for the Minist&egrave;re de l'Instruction Publique, Maxime Du Camp (1822&#150;1894) sets out for the Middle East, where he will make a photographic inventory of the sights and monuments of Egypt, Palestine, and Syria. Du Camp's archaeological reportage inspires many others to make the journey in the 1850s.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1851</strong> After the failure of a proposed constitutional amendment that would allow the president to serve for more than one term, Louis-Napoleon mobilizes a military coup d'&eacute;tat that results in the fall of the Second Republic. He is named emperor of the Second Empire in the following year.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1851</strong> The French government initiates a project of documenting the nation's architectural heritage, assigning five photographers, including Gustave Le Gray (1820&#150;1884) and &Eacute;douard Baldus (1813&#150;1889), to record different regions of the country.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1853</strong> Gaspard-F&eacute;lix Tournachon (1820&#150;1910), known as Nadar, opens a photographic studio soon to become a hub of the most illustrious personalities of the day. Known to posterity for his elegant portraits of such luminaries as the actress Sarah Bernhardt and writer Charles Baudelaire, Nadar is better known to his contemporaries as a novelist and essayist.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1854</strong> American Commodore Matthew Perry and the Tokugawa shogunate conclude the Kanagawa treaty that opens Japan, hitherto an isolationist country, to trade with the West (limited trade, particularly with Dutch merchants, had been permitted up to this point). Shortly thereafter, Japanese wares&#151;furniture, decorative objects, textiles, and prints&#151;are widely available in Europe and avidly collected by an affluent bourgeoisie, including artists such as Edgar Degas and Claude Monet, and writers such as Baudelaire, Edmond and Jules de Goncourt, and &Eacute;mile Zola. Japanese pictorial arts, especially prints, and other aspects of the Japanese aesthetic exert a profound influence on contemporary French artists, authors, and composers. In 1872, the critic and collector Philippe Burty uses the term <I>japonisme</I> to refer to this widespread cultural phenomenon and to promote its study.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1855</strong> The Exposition Universelle, including a major art exhibition, is held in Paris with the aim of displaying the social, industrial, and cultural progress in France under Napoleon III. Realist painter Gustave Courbet (1819&#150;1877) submits a monumental canvas, <I>The Painter's Studio: A Real Allegory Summing Up Seven Years of My Artistic Life</I>, to the exposition jury, who reject it. Outraged by the stylistic strictures imposed by the Academy of Fine Arts, Courbet organizes a private exhibition in a tent near the fairground entrance, calling it his Pavilion of Realism. Courbet's radical departure from academic tradition had rocked the art world six years earlier, when he exhibited three pictures&#151;<I>Peasants of Flagey Returning from the Fair</I>, <I>After Dinner at Ornans</I>, and <I>A Burial at Ornans</I>&#151;at the Salon of 1849. These works, depicting the landscape and inhabitants of his rural birthplace, elevate scenes from everyday life to the grand scale formerly reserved for history painting. Courbet's pictures espouse the cry of contemporary critic Charles Baudelaire (1821&#150;1867) in his review of the Salon of 1846 for an art that reflects the "heroism of modern life," and he leads a generation of Realist painters that has as its literary counterpart the circle of Baudelaire, author of <I>Les fleurs du mal </I>(<I>The Flowers of Evil</I>), and Gustave Flaubert (1821&#150;1880), author of <I>Madame Bovary </I>(both 1857).</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1858</strong> English dress designer Charles Frederick Worth</a> (1825&#150;1895), often regarded as "the father of haute couture</a>," opens a firm in Paris. The House of Worth dominates Parisian fashion through the second half of the nineteenth century.</li>

<strong><P>&#149; late 1850s</strong> The increasing popularity of photography encourages the development of faster printing processes and the circulation of inexpensive types of photographic prints, including the stereograph and the carte-de-visite.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1861</strong> Construction begins on the Paris Op&eacute;ra, designed by Charles Garnier (1825&#150;1898). It is conceived by Baron Georges-Eug&egrave;ne Haussmann (1809&#150;1891), city planner under Napoleon III, as the converging point of several major boulevards. Incorporating Renaissance and Baroque architectural elements and decorative motifs, the ornate structure symbolizes Second Empire decadence, the appeal of which endures well after the empire's fall. Its profuse exterior adornment includes <I>The Dance</I> by Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux (1827&#150;1875), a Beaux-Arts sculptor who rises to prominence with <I>Ugolino and His Sons</I> (1860&#150;62; Louvre; see MMA 67.250</a>) at the Salon of 1863. The Op&eacute;ra is completed in 1875.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; ca. 1862</strong> Honor&eacute; Daumier (1808&#150;1879) paints <I>The Third-Class Carriage</I> (29.100.129</a>), an unidealized portrayal of the living conditions of the working class and the psychological isolation symptomatic of modern urban life. The artist is already well known for the satirical drawings and political cartoons he produces for Paris weeklies, such as <I>Rue Transnonain, April 15, 1834</I> (57.650.192), depicting the wake of a massacre of working-class opponents of the oppressive government under Louis-Philippe.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1863</strong> The Salon des Refus&eacute;s is established for the exhibition of works rejected by the Salon jury (more than half the submissions for this year are rejected), and includes pictures by C&eacute;zanne</a>, Pissarro, Whistler, and &Eacute;douard Manet</a> (1832&#150;1883). Many of the works displayed generate controversy, particularly Manet's canvas <I>Luncheon on the Grass (Le D&eacute;jeuner sur l'herbe</I>; Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay, Paris). While its composition of male figures reclining in a clearing with a nude female figure derives from classical and Renaissance sources (see Marcantonio Raimondi's engraving after Raphael, 19.74.1</a>), its contemporaneity and directness of approach shock modern audiences. Manet stirs a second scandal with <I>Olympia </I>(Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay), painted in 1863 and exhibited at the Salon of 1865. In a composition that recalls old master paintings, notably the <I>Venus of Urbino</I> by Titian</a>, a nude female figure reclines on a couch. Manet's modern courtesan, who unabashedly engages the viewer's glance, arouses critical disgust and claims of indecency and vulgarity.</li>

<strong><P>&#149; 1866</strong> Jules Ch&eacute;ret (1836&#150;1932) popularizes a technique of color lithography that marks the rise of the modern advertising poster. His designs influence the painter and graphic artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864&#150;1901), who captures in his brief but prolific career the gaiety&#151;and, often, the garishness&#151;of the theaters, circuses, and cabarets of fin-de-si&egrave;cle Paris.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1870</strong> The Franco-Prussian War breaks out, ending in French defeat. At the fall of Napoleon III, the Third Republic is established. In the following year, a socialist Commune is set up in Paris (March 18&#150;May 29); Gustave Courbet is an active participant in Commune politics, and leads a commission for the protection of artistic monuments. After the Commune's overthrow, Courbet is accused of ordering the demolition of the Vend&ocirc;me Column, a symbol of Napoleonic rule; he is imprisoned and, declared responsible for the column's restoration, flees to Switzerland shortly after his release in 1873, living there in exile until his death in 1877.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1874</strong> The first of eight exhibitions of Impressionist painting is held in Nadar's studio in Paris, featuring works by Claude Monet (1840&#150;1926), Edgar Degas (1834&#150;1917), Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1841&#150;1919), Berthe Morisot (1841&#150;1895), Alfred Sisley (1839&#150;1899), and Camille Pissarro (1830&#150;1903). Maligned by critics, one of whom coins the term <I>impressionisme</I> pejoratively after Monet's <I>Impression: Sunrise, 1872</I> (Mus&eacute;e Marmottan Monet, Paris), this group of artists is dedicated to the depiction of modern life, especially landscape and genre subjects, based on direct observation. They develop a style of painting with loose, broken brushstrokes that mirrors the often fleeting nature of their subjects.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1874</strong> American painter Mary Cassatt (1844&#150;1926) settles in Paris. Her cosmopolitan upbringing and early travels allow her access to studies with such masters as Jean-L&eacute;on G&eacute;r&ocirc;me (1824&#150;1904) and Thomas Couture (1815&#150;1879), and she exhibits at the Salon for the first time in 1868. By the mid-1870s, her style becomes less Academic, and she exhibits with the Impressionists in 1880, 1881, and 1886. Cassatt later displays her refined draftsmanship and graphic technique in paintings and prints&#151;particularly of maternal scenes&#151;markedly inspired by the Japanese aesthetic. In her later years, she acts as advisor to several American friends in purchasing old master and nineteenth-century French avant-garde art; among them is Louisine Havemeyer (1855&#150;1929), who bequeaths nearly 2,000 paintings and art objects from her collection to the Metropolitan Museum in 1929.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1874</strong> The young American expatriate John Singer Sargent (1856&#150;1925) enters the studio of portraitist Carolus-Duran (1838&#150;1917) in Paris. He will soon achieve his own success as a portraitist, depicting with liveliness and elegance the American and European elite of his age, as in his portrait of Madame Pierre Gautreau, known as <I>Madame X</I> (1883&#150;84; 16.53</a>). Sargent is also a gifted plein-air landscapist.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1875</strong> Georges Bizet's (1838&#150;1875) opera <I>Carmen</I> is performed for the first time in Paris; it is a critical failure. Despite its musical vivacity and complex psychological characterizations, contemporary audiences are unsympathetic to the opera's realism and the inspiration Bizet takes from the German Romantic composer Richard Wagner (1813&#150;1883), who himself faced great unpopularity during his three-year stay in Paris (1839&#150;42).</li>
<strong><P>&#149; late 1870s</strong> Paul C&eacute;zanne (1839&#150;1906) turns away from Impressionism, seeking to imbue objects and landscapes with a sense of solidity and permanence by reducing them to their basic geometric forms: the cube, cone, and cylinder. Though not commercially successful in his lifetime, C&eacute;zanne's approach to painting, broadly categorized as Post-Impressionist, influences major movements in twentieth-century art, especially Cubism.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1880</strong> Auguste Rodin (1840&#150;1917) is commissioned to execute a sculptural portal for a planned museum of decorative arts (never realized); he chooses Dante's <I>Inferno</I> as the subject, and calls his doors <I>The Gates of Hell</I>, an allusion to Lorenzo Ghiberti's <I>Gates of Paradise</I> (ca. 1426&#150;52) for the Baptistery of the cathedral in Florence. The lintel, pilasters, and door panels are adorned with reliefs of the turbulently swirling, tortured forms that inhabit Dante's hell, most of which are identifiable. Several of Rodin's major sculptures, including <I>The Thinker</I> (originally conceived as a portrayal of Dante) and <I>The Kiss</I> (a representation of the ill-fated lovers Paolo and Francesca), are enlarged versions of figures that appear on <I>The Gates of Hell</I>.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1881</strong> Edgar Degas (1834&#150;1917) exhibits <I>The Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer </I>(29.100.370</a>) at the sixth Impressionist exhibition. The wax sculpture, wearing a real tulle skirt and horsehair wig tied with a silk ribbon, causes a scandal because of its naturalistic depiction of the young model. Performers&#151;ballet dancers, opera singers, and musicians&#151;recur in Degas' oeuvre, which spans several media, including paint, pastel, wax, and photography. Degas is a gifted draftsman, capturing through sophisticated compositional technique the self-conscious poise of ballerinas and the casual postures of solitary bathers.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1886</strong> Painter Georges Seurat (1859&#150;1891) completes <I>A Sunday on La Grande Jatte</I> (1884&#150;5; Art Institute of Chicago; see MMA 51.112.6</a>). The artist employs a technique known variously as Divisionism or Pointillism, in which small patches or dots of pure colors are juxtaposed to produce a visual harmony when viewed from a distance. This systematic method, rooted in contemporary color theories, places Seurat at the forefront of the Neo-Impressionist</a> movement, along with Paul Signac (1863&#150;1935) and Lucien Pissarro (1863&#150;1944), son of Camille Pissarro. Works by these artists appear in the last Impressionist exhibition of 1886.</li>

<strong><P>&#149; 1886</strong> &Eacute;mile Zola (1840&#150;1902) publishes <I>L'Oeuvre</I>, a novel that addresses the aesthetic issues of the later nineteenth century. The author-critic rejects contemporary Academic painting, asserts the imprint of an artist's personality or temperament on his work, and champions the painter &Eacute;douard Manet (1832&#150;1883) as the leader of a "modern school of Naturalism." At the publication of <I>L'Oeuvre</I>, Paul C&eacute;zanne, a close childhood friend of Zola, claims to recognize himself in the primary character Claude Lantier, a failed artist who commits suicide; the two fall out and never speak again.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1886</strong> Jean Mor&eacute;as (1856&#150;1910) publishes a Symbolist manifesto in the widely read periodical <I>Le Figaro</I>, arguing for an aesthetic that rejects naturalism in favor of the subjective world of dreams, nuances, and the imagination. Admired by and closely associated with the work of the Symbolists</a> are painters Gustave Moreau (1826&#150;1898)&#151;who engages the opposing tensions of physicality, spirituality, desire, and morality in canvases such as <I>Oedipus and the Sphinx</I> (21.134.1</a>) and several works on the theme of Salome&#151;and Odilon Redon (1840&#150;1916), an admirer of Francisco Goya</a> and Edgar Allan Poe who evokes a fantastic, visionary dream-world in works such as the lithograph <I>Marsh Flower: A Sad Human Face</I> (1885).</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1888</strong> In Brittany, painter and graphic artist Paul Gauguin</a> (1848&#150;1903) and &Eacute;mile Bernard (1868&#150;1941) produce paintings of simplified, flattened forms rendered in bold, unmodulated colors. This style, which they call "Synthetism," is Symbolist in its intent to convey emotions and ideas beyond representing the visual world. A characteristic Synthetist work is Gauguin's 1888 canvas<I> The Vision after the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel</I> (National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh).</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1888</strong> In February, Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh</a> (1853&#150;1890) departs Paris for Arles in the south of France, hoping to establish an artists' community. Under the bright sulphur-yellow light of Provence, his work comes into its own as he realizes the expressive potential of color and line. On October 23, he is joined by Paul Gauguin; they spend 9 weeks painting side by side and living together in the Yellow House. Gauguin's abrupt departure on December 23 is precipitated by Van Gogh's breakdown, during which he cuts off part of his left ear with a razor.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1888</strong> A group of young artists form the Nabis, from the Hebrew word for "prophet," with the aim of promoting decorative painting as inspired by Gauguin's Synthetist model. Maurice Denis (1870&#150;1943) is a founding member of the Nabis and writes in an article of 1890 for <I>La Revue Blanche</I>, "Remember that a picture, before being a war horse, a female nude, or some anecdote, is essentially a flat surface covered with colors assembled in a certain order." Other core members include Paul S&eacute;rusier (1864&#150;1927), Pierre Bonnard</a> (1867&#150;1947), Ker-Xavier Roussel (1867&#150;1944), and &Eacute;douard Vuillard (1868&#150;1940). The Nabis are associated with the Symbolist movement.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1889</strong> The Exposition Universelle is held in Paris as a centennial celebration of the French Revolution. The Eiffel Tower, a 984-foot-high iron structure designed by Gustave Eiffel (1832&#150;1923) and erected between 1887 and 1889, stands near the fairground entrance on the Champ de Mars as a symbol of the triumph of science, engineering, and industry.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1890</strong> Claude Monet</a>, chief exponent of Impressionism, purchases a house in Giverny, whose landscape profoundly inspires him. About this time, he begins the first of several series of paintings depicting a single subject in various conditions of light and weather. His subjects include haystacks (29.100.109</a>), poplars, the facade of Rouen Cathedral, and water lilies. He exhibits these during the 1890s in several one-man shows at the Durand-Ruel Gallery in Paris.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1891</strong> Paul Gauguin</a> makes his first trip to Tahiti, where he stays until 1893. There he paints <I>Ia Orana Maria (Hail Mary)</I> (51.112.2</a>), in which he adapts the vernacular art and customs of the South Pacific to express a Christian theme. The two central figures are based on a photograph of a low relief in the Javanese temple of Borobudur, characteristic of Gauguin's liberal borrowing from photography and other sources. A late work, <I>Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?</I> (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), painted in Papeete in 1897, is Gauguin's allegorical variation on the theme of the three ages of man&#151;or in this case, woman, here represented by female figures in a Tahitian landscape.</li>

<strong><P>&#149; 1892</strong> Captain Alfred Dreyfus (1859&#150;1935), an Alsatian Jew and French general staff officer, is tried and wrongly convicted for passing French secret documents to a German military attach&eacute;. The resultant controversy, known as The Dreyfus Affair, is largely the result of anti-Semitism in France. After the court martial and nearly immediate acquittal (1898) of the actual traitor, Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy, the pro-Dreyfus critic &Eacute;mile Zola publishes "J'accuse," an open letter to the president of the French Republic accusing the judges of acquitting Esterhazy on orders from the war office. Zola is tried for libel and sentenced to jail, but flees to England. Dreyfus is finally exonerated in 1906.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1894</strong> Claude Debussy (1862&#150;1918) composes the <I>Pr&eacute;lude &agrave; l'apr&egrave;s-midi d'un faune</I> (<I>Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun</I>), an orchestral work inspired by St&eacute;phane Mallarm&eacute;'s poem of 1876. Debussy is the major exponent of an impressionistic movement in music that rejects narrative and drama&#151;ideals championed by Romantic composers such as Richard Wagner&#151;with the aim of evoking subtleties of mood, atmosphere, and transitory impressions. Inspired by contemporary painting by Monet and Symbolist poetry, Debussy achieves impressionistic effects through the use of new chord combinations, whole-tone chords, pentatonic pitch collections, timbre, and unresolved dissonances. He is also closely associated with the Symbolist movement in music, which, like its counterparts in the visual arts and literature, rejects a strict adherence to naturalism in favor of evocation, suggestion, and imagination.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1895</strong> German entrepreneur Siegfried Bing (1838&#150;1905) expands and reopens his Oriental crafts shop in Paris as the Maison de l'Art Nouveau. Bing is a specialist in Eastern arts, and promotes a Japanese aesthetic as a means of uniting art and craft in a manner that imbues even the most utilitarian object with a simple beauty. He is credited&#151;through the foundation of a periodical, <I>Le Japon Artistique</I>, and various exhibitions of ancient artifacts and contemporary works&#151;with the promotion of japonisme</a> in France. The Art Nouveau</a> style borrows from Japanese art its emphasis on linear ornamental motifs such as intertwining vegetal forms. Bing's Maison de l'Art Nouveau</a> features designs by the painters &Eacute;douard Vuillard, Maurice Denis, and Paul Ranson (1864&#150;1909), as well as Belgian architect Henry van de Velde (1863&#150;1957). Other masters of this style are Hector Guimard (1867&#150;1942), designer of the elegant cast-iron tendrils that adorn entrances to the Paris M&eacute;tro (ca. 1900), and Ren&eacute; Lalique (1860&#150;1945), jewelry and glassware designer.</li>
