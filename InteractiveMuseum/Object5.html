This panel, painted in Antwerp around 1618, is one of the few very good examples of van Dyck's early work as a portraitist. It is distinctly Flemish in style, compared with even slightly later portraits such as those of Frans Snyders and Margaretha de Vos in The Frick Collection. The latter already reveal a painterly technique and an elegance inspired by Titian, while here the insistent sense of volume and texture, the costume details, the passive pose and expression, and the close harmony of tones are traditional qualities that call to mind earlier Northern portraits such as those by Anthonis Mor.</br></br>

<a id="heilbrunnLink1" href="#"><strong>Rembrandt van Rijn (1606&ndash;1669): Paintings</strong></a></br>
<div id="heilbrunn1">

<P><P>A prolific painter, draftsman, and etcher</a>, Rembrandt is usually regarded as the greatest artist of Holland's "Golden Age." He worked first in his native Leiden and, from 1632 onward, in Amsterdam, where he had studied briefly (ca. 1624) with the influential history painter Pieter Lastman. Rembrandt never went abroad, but he voraciously surveyed the work of Northern artists who had lived in Italy</a>, like Lastman, the Utrecht painter Gerrit van Honthorst (Rembrandt's main link to Caravaggio</a>), Anthony van Dyck</a>, and&#151;mostly through prints&#151;Adam Elsheimer and Peter Paul Rubens</a>. In the Leiden period, Rembrandt also responded strongly to earlier Netherlandish artists such as Lucas van Leyden (1489/94&#150;1533). However, a crucial aspect of Rembrandt's development was his intense study of people, objects, and their surroundings "from life</a>," as is obvious in paintings like his early self-portraits and the <em>Saint Paul in Prison</em> of 1627 (Stuttgart, Staatsgalerie). Even by Dutch standards, Rembrandt's preoccupation with direct observation was exceptional and continued throughout his career. Despite the constant evolution of his style, Rembrandt's compelling descriptions of light, space, atmosphere, modeling, texture, and human situations may be traced back even from his late works (such as <em>The Jewish Bride</em></a>, Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum) to the foundations of his Leiden years. It was also this program, in good part, that made Rembrandt a great teacher. His many pupils included Gerrit Dou, Govert Flinck, Ferdinand Bol, Nicolaes Maes, and Carel Fabritius.</P></P>



		<p><P>In Amsterdam, Rembrandt became a prominent portraitist, attracting attention with dramatic compositions like <em>The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp</em></a> (1632; The Hague, Mauritshuis). In securing commissions, the artist was assisted by the Mennonite art dealer Hendrick Uylenburgh, whose cousin Saskia married Rembrandt in 1634. The Mennonites advocated personal interpretation of scripture, which probably influenced Rembrandt's subjective and often moving treatment of biblical subjects. The artist became highly successful in the 1630s, when he had several pupils and assistants, started his own art collection, and lived the life of a cultivated gentleman, especially in the impressive residence he purchased in 1639 (now the "Rembrandt House" museum). Rembrandt exudes confidence and urbanity in his <em>Self-Portrait</em></a> of 1640 (London, National Gallery), which was modeled upon courtly portraits by Raphael and Titian</a>. These artists probably also inspired his Amsterdam signature, "Rembrandt" (dropping "van Rijn").<br /><br />In the 1640s, Rembrandt's frequently theatrical style of the previous decade gave way to a more contemplative manner, a mature example of which is <em>Aristotle with a Bust of Homer</em> (1653; 61.198</a>). The change reflects period taste but also personal circumstances, such as Saskia's death in 1642, financial problems, and the artist's controversial relationship with his son's nurse, Geertje Dircks, and then with his maidservant (and close companion) Hendrickje Stoffels. The great group portrait known as <em>The Night Watch</em></a>, dated 1642 (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum), could be said to mark the end of Rembrandt's most successful years, but the legend that customer dissatisfaction ruined his reputation is refuted by later commissions from such prominent patrons as Jan Six and the Amsterdam city government. The extraordinary volume of Rembrandt's production even after he declared insolvency in 1656 is punctuated by dozens of masterworks, like <em>The Syndics of the Amsterdam Drapers' Guild</em></a> (1662; Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum).<br /><br />The powers of invention and perception that made Rembrandt a famous painter in his own time also made him a virtuoso draftsman (as is evident in works as different as <em>The Last Supper</em> after Leonardo da Vinci</a> and <em>Cottage among Trees</em> (29.100.939</a>) and the most innovative printmaker</a> of the seventeenth century. In about 350 etchings, he extended the medium's capacity to suggest various kinds of illumination and painterly effects. Some examples, like <em>The Three Crosses</em> of 1653, were radically revised in design and expression between different states.<br /><br />Rembrandt inspired numerous seventeenth-century Dutch and German painters, as well as eighteenth-century artists throughout Europe (for example, Fragonard</a> and Tiepolo</a>) and a broad range of nineteenth-century realists. Many imitations were made in later periods, but the great majority of Rembrandtesque paintings that are not by the master date from his lifetime and suggest that his approach appealed to a fairly large audience, especially in Amsterdam.</P>

<a id="heilbrunnLink2" href="#"><strong>Portrait Painting in England, 1600&ndash;1800 </strong></a></br>
<div id="heilbrunn2">

<P><P>Portraiture has played a dominant role in England since the Renaissance, when the arts declaimed the legitimacy of the Tudor dynasty, while the Protestant Reformation</a> effected a drastic decline in commissions for religious images. A relatively stable monarchy in concert with a powerful landed aristocracy provided continuity and patronage. The portrait miniature flourished. Portraits and caricatures accounted for a significant percentage of the prints</a> made for sale or as book illustrations. Ceramics, silhouettes, coins, medals, and waxes bore likenesses. Portraits in exceptionally large numbers figured in interiors, where they were arranged to convey domestic as well as political and dynastic messages.</P></P>



		<p><P><strong>The Tudor (1485&#150;1603) and Stuart (1603&#150;49, 1660&#150;1714) Periods</strong><br />In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, many portraitists who worked in England were not native born. During the reign of Henry VIII (r. 1509&#150;47), the most distinguished artist in London was Hans Holbein the Younger of Augsburg. By 1526, when he made his first trip to England, he had achieved unparalleled mastery of the means by which to create the illusion of the physical presence of a sitter. His clients in the 1530s included the German merchants of the Hanseatic League who resided in London (50.135.4</a>) as well as royalty, courtiers, and their household servants (50.145.24</a>).</p><p>Most distinguished of the Tudor miniaturists was Nicholas Hilliard, whose delicate, finely wrought technique reflects his training as a goldsmith (35.89.4</a>, 32.100.311</a>). The early work of Samuel Cooper demonstrates the broader handling typical of the Stuart period as well as the sobriety that characterizes the art of the Commonwealth. Cooper's uncle was John Hoskins, whose supple style and fine characterizations betray an awareness of Anthony van Dyck</a>. The Flemish artist also influenced the Dutch-born portraitist Peter Lely, who became Charles II's principal painter. Lely's work is notable for its depth of tone, richness of color, and sensual elegance (39.65.3</a>). Both Cooper and Lely flourished not only under the Puritans but also after the Restoration.</p><p><strong>The Georgian (1714&#150;1830) Era</strong><br />The major Georgian portraitists worked primarily in London, where they catered to a flourishing market and, from 1768, exhibited at the Royal Academy. Patronized by the aristocracy, the demi-monde, and the middle classes, they were lionized or chastised in the press. Chief among them was Joshua Reynolds, first president of the Academy, author of the influential <em>Discourses on Art</em>, and principal painter to George III (r. 1760&#150;1820). Reynolds, master of the perfectly calibrated pose and gesture, had a sure sense of what was appropriate to a sitter's age (50.238.2</a>), sex (20.155.3</a>), and social or political position. By contrast, Thomas Gainsborough was a natural painter, with a fluid, assured technique and a sharp eye for the particular characteristic of the great beauties of his age (20.155.1</a>). Both Gainsborough and George Romney were also skilled draftsmen, while Romney practiced a classicizing painting style (49.7.57</a>). John Hoppner was thought to have been a truthful painter. A father of five, he was particularly good at capturing childish traits (53.59.3</a>). In 1792, Thomas Lawrence succeeded Reynolds as painter to George III. Lawrence's vivid, increasingly romantic images are characterized by flawless, exuberant handling (50.135.5</a>).</P>

<a id="heilbrunnLink3" href="#"><strong>The Materials and Techniques of English Embroidery of the Late Tudor and Stuart Eras</strong></a></br>
<div id="heilbrunn3">

<P><P>In a 1961 article on English embroidery of the Tudor and Stuart periods</a>, Gertrude Townsend, then curator of textiles at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, made a plea "to those studying embroideries of this period, now to be found widely scattered in collections in Europe and America, [for the exchange of] photographs, taken under precisely the same magnification. Valuable comparisons of techniques could be made without the necessity of bringing the embroideries together in one place." Advances in digital technology have revolutionized both photography and communication, making it possible to capture images of embroidery techniques under magnification with great precision and to share these images globally with ease.</P></P>



		<p><P><B>Production</B><br />Working with fine silk</a> floss in combination with metal elements was an established practice among professional embroiderers</a> by the sixteenth century. Whether for reasons of economy or for ease of application, embroiderers before the sixteenth century restricted the use of metal threads to visible surfaces of the work. By the second half of the century, expanding trade and developments in technology had led to an increased availability of gold</a>, silver, and silk. Embroidered works of this period are distinguished by their great expressiveness, which resulted in part from an inventive use of luxury goods. These embroideries demonstrate a high level of skill in combining metal elements with silk floss and a sophisticated use of metal strips and wires of different thicknesses, widths, and shapes to create a broad range of effects. The varied reflective surfaces of the metals create rich and changeable tonal effects on the foundation fabrics and the polychrome silk embroidery threads. Materials and techniques were manipulated with control to create works that mimic natural forms.</p><p><B>Foundation Fabrics</B><br />Embroideries were worked primarily on two types of foundation fabrics: off-white silk in satin weave and undyed linen in plain weave, referred to as canvas. The embroidery technique determined the choice of foundation fabric. Tent stitch, cross stitch, and Gobelin stitch were worked on canvas. The canvas used in the objects included in this selection is a balanced plain weave with a warp and weft count of 15 to 16 threads per centimeter. The fine warp and weft threads create a fabric well suited for silk embroidery thread.</p><p>The satin fabric was used with a broad range of stitches. The silk satin foundation fabric used in the examples discussed here is composed of warp-faced 8-end satin. The high count (160 per centimeter) of the slightly S-twisted silk warp creates a smooth surface, while the much lower count (36 per centimeter) of the thicker Z-twisted silk weft provides a firm structure that remains on grain while it is worked and evenly supports the weight of the finished embroidery.</p><p>The smooth surface of the satin is a luminous ground, enhancing the reflective qualities of the metal surfaces and the luster of the silk embroidery floss and pearls.</p><p><B>Silk Thread</B><br />Embroiderers of this time bought their silk as loosely spun floss, in both natural color and dyed.</p><p>In the examples discussed here, the silk is most often used as a two-ply thread, with both S-spin and S-ply. Silk was used in a variety of embroidery stitches on both canvas and satin. Silk floss was also prepared into a fine cord by winding silk filaments tightly around a silk core.</p><p><B>Metal Elements</B><br />Metal thread, referred to in this essay as fil&eacute;, was made up of metal strip wrapped around a silk thread core. Metal strip was made from fine wire ranging in these examples between .1 and .2 millimeters. The wire was used both round and flattened. The color and twist of the silk core, the size of the strip, and the angle and direction in which the metal strip was applied determined the appearance of the thread.</p><p>In general, yellow silk was used with gold and white silk with silver to emphasize the color of the metal. The color of the core was sometimes reversed to create a contrast, or more than one color was used, creating complex tonal effects (29.23.15</a>).</p><p>Metal was also employed without a silk component. Fine wire was used for small coils known as purl. Metal purl was fabricated by winding a wire tightly around a rod or a wire. Wire was prepared in different ways to create various effects. Often the wire to be wound was first wrapped with silk floss, called silk purl. The silk floss could be of one color or combined to form stripes. Sometimes a metal strip was added over the silk wrap, wound around the silk at an angle to show the color of the silk thread (29.23.15</a>). This covered wire was shaped in the same way as the metal purl. The fine wire used for purl was easily cut and could be applied to the foundation fabric with a variety of methods allowing the embroiderer to create different effects.</p><p><B>Wire</B><br />Wire of different gauges was used either round or flattened and in different colors and weights. The contours of the coil were determined by shape and size of the rod. Once the coil was shaped, the rod was removed and the coil was ready for use. Metal coils were attached to the work with silk thread that was either pulled through its center or had couching stitches laid across it. In this essay, fine wire coils are referred to as metal purl or silk purl and heavier gauge wires are referred to as metal coils.</p><p>Embroidered work was often embellished with round or tear-shaped spangles, which were particularly favored on apparel and accessories where the movement of the wearer would enhance their reflective qualities. Spangles were fabricated in several ways, two of which can be identified in the examples that follow. The tear-shaped spangles were stamped from sheets of metal plate. A row of holes was punched out in the metal plate to create the hole, and then a tear-shaped stamp was punched over each hole. These spangles were frequently incorporated into the metal laces that were often sewn along hemmed edges. The asymmetrical shape and off-center hole of the spangles allows them maximum movement, free from the lace (28.220.3,.4</a>).</p><p>Round spangles could also be stamped from metal sheets, but the examples here were made with wire, a method that seems to have been much in use in this period. A single coil was cut from wire purl and flattened, with the ends of the wire overlapping (28.220.3,.4</a>). The round spangles could be held in place with small stitches in silk thread or with a short length of purl (28.220.3,.4</a>). Embellishments of all descriptions were sewn to the foundation fabric. By varying the color and placement of the silk thread, the embroiderer could achieve a variety of effects.</p><p><B>Evolution of Techniques</B><br />With the evolution of needle lace late in the sixteenth century, the use of detached needle lace in costume</a> and accessories became increasingly popular. During the seventeenth century, flower petals and leaves were among the many details created in needle lace and attached to the embroidered motifs, often in combination with metal elements. Detached needle lace was most often worked in variations of the buttonhole stitch. The stitch was often worked with a fine wire incorporated into the border, which allowed the detached details to be shaped above the surface of the embroidery. Initially, detached needle lace was used as a detail for an embroidered motif. The effects of these details were enhanced with padding, usually wool batting, or by layering embroidery threads, a technique long employed by professional embroiderers. Increasingly ambitious effects were achieved with a variety of materials, including silk and linen thread, wool batting, paper, wooden molds, pasteboard, and wire. These filling materials were used with the embroidery on the foundation fabric and also with detached needle motifs.</p><p>The materials and techniques found in raised work were not new, but they were used with inventiveness and skill to create works with unprecedented dimensional qualities. Dimensional effects became increasingly inventive, culminating in the middle of the seventeenth century with raised work, which often incorporated separately worked three-dimensional motifs into the embroidered composition (64.101.1335</a>).</P>

<a id="heilbrunnLink4" href="#"><strong>Peter Paul Rubens (1577&ndash;1640) and Anthony van Dyck (1599&ndash;1641): Paintings</strong></a></br>
<div id="heilbrunn4">

<P><P>Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck, the greatest Flemish artists of the seventeenth century, were prominent figures on an international stage, namely that of the Catholic church and the royal courts and commercial centers of Europe. As a painter of religious pictures, mythological scenes, classical and modern history, and portraits, Rubens had a broader impact than van Dyck. But as a portraitist</a>, van Dyck was far more influential, especially in England, where he spent most of the 1630s and his works inspired artists for the next 150 years (Thomas Gainsborough [20.155.1</a>]was his most gifted admirer). Van Dyck was also a highly expressive painter of religious themes and, as a draftsman</a>, a sensitive landscapist, although in the latter field Rubens surpassed every other Flemish painter (<em>A Forest at Dawn with a Deer Hunt</em> [1990.196</a>] is one of a few dozen landscapes Rubens painted mainly for his own pleasure.) Van Dyck's reputation as a portraitist was enhanced by his large series of etchings</a> called the Iconography. Not a printmaker but an astute entrepreneur, Rubens supervised the reproduction of his compositions in hundreds of engravings</a>.</P></P>



		<p><P>In contrast to the teenaged prodigy van Dyck, who was about twenty-one when he painted the self-portrait illustrated here (49.7.25</a>), Rubens did not develop quickly as an artist. In his early years, he received an exceptional education, experience as a page in a noble house, and training in the studios of three Antwerp painters, most importantly that of Otto van Veen, who probably encouraged Rubens's trip to Italy in 1600. Here he absorbed profound impressions from classical sculpture and the works of Italian artists such as Raphael, Leonardo</a>, Michelangelo, Correggio, Tintoretto, Caravaggio</a>, and Annibale Carracci</a>. Rubens remained in Italy for eight years, supported by commissions from the duke of Mantua, Genoese nobility, and great Roman patrons, including major orders of the Catholic church. Before the end of 1608, when he returned to Antwerp, he had painted some of the most important altarpieces in Genoa, Rome, and elsewhere in Italy. This experience provided the groundwork for his extraordinary output of religious pictures during the next fifteen years in Antwerp, which he managed by organizing a large workshop of pupils and assistants.</p><p>Rubens was appointed court painter to Archduke Albert and Archduchess Isabella, who governed the Southern Netherlands from Brussels on behalf of Spain. However, the artist chose to remain in Antwerp, where he married and built a house and large studio in a Northern version of the modern Italian style. The altarpieces he supplied to Antwerp churches&#151;like the two great triptychs now in the Antwerp Cathedral, <em>The Raising of the Cross</em> and <em>The Descent from the Cross</em>&#151;were often funded by distinguished laymen with a discerning knowledge of the arts, such as the burgomaster Nicolaes Rockox. The <em>Wolf and Fox Hunt</em> of about 1615&#150;21 (10.73</a>) is the first of several large hunting pictures that Rubens made as alternatives to tapestries and sold to patrons like the duke of Bavaria. He also collaborated with other Antwerp artists, for instance, Jan Brueghel the Elder (45.141</a>) and Frans Snyders, to produce mythological and other pictures intended mainly for connoisseurs.</p><p>In all of these works&#151;religious paintings, tapestry designs</a>, book illustrations, and other projects&#151;Rubens exhibited extraordinary learning and imagination. Among the many examples of his insightfully conceived iconographic programs was the spectacular series of thirty-nine ceiling paintings for the Jesuit Church in Antwerp. The canvases (later destroyed in a fire) were actually painted mostly by van Dyck, after Rubens's oil sketches, his preferred method of formulating compositions. These modelli (models), fluid studies in oil paint on comparatively small wooden panels, were used both as proposals to patrons and as guides for assistants. One of the few hundred known examples is <em>The Triumph of Henry IV</em> of about 1630 (42.187</a>), the last of four oil sketches for a monumental canvas now in the Uffizi, Florence. The painting was part of a large cycle of canvases, never completed, that would have decorated the Luxembourg Palace in Paris. The pendant cycle of twenty-four paintings depicting the life of Maria de' Medici (Louvre, Paris) was installed in the palace in 1625.</p><p>In the later 1620s, the demands of Rubens's international clientele and his role in peace negotiations between England and Spain made him the "most harassed man in the world" (as he complained in his extensive correspondence). He spent seven months in Madrid in 1628&#150;29, where he portrayed the royal family and made copies after Titian</a>, and nine months in London in 1629&#150;30 (the ceiling paintings of the Banqueting House at Whitehall, London, were completed in Antwerp by 1634). In 1630, Rubens remarried (1981.238</a>) and in the next few years organized his studio to work efficiently in his absence; large-scale projects such as the decoration of the Torre de la Parada (Philip IV's hunting lodge near Madrid) and the decorative scheme for the triumphal entry into Antwerp of the new governor, Cardinal Infante Ferdinand, were executed almost entirely by assistants and collaborators following the master's designs. However, numerous landscapes, unofficial portraits, and other pictures were painted entirely by Rubens during this period, either in Antwerp or at his country estate of Steen (purchased in 1635). He died in 1640, leaving behind five children, an impressive art collection, and a body of work that profoundly influenced artists&#151;including Watteau</A>, Boucher</A>, Fragonard</a>, Reynolds, G&eacute;ricault, and Delacroix&#151;for more than two centuries.</p><p>The first important painters to respond to Rubens's work were Jacob Jordaens and van Dyck in Antwerp. Both artists adopted Rubens's practice of painting studies of live models (usually in bust-length) for later use as characters in religious pictures. (Van Dyck's <em>Study Head of a Young Woman</em> of about 1618&#150;20 [57.37</a>] may have become a repentant Magdalen or mourning Virgin, although no precise use is known.) Van Dyck began training as a painter under Hendrick van Balen the Elder at the age of ten; he already had his own studio and pupil when he joined the painters' guild in 1618. By the fall of 1620, the young painter of portraits and religious pictures was in the service of King James I of England, but in 1621 he returned to Antwerp and then departed for Italy, where he remained until late 1627. While there, he painted grand portraits of Genoese aristocrats and numerous other distinguished figures (14.40.619</a>). He also studied antiquity and Italian painters, concentrating&#151;far more than Rubens had&#151;on the single model of Titian. The latter's influence is evident in <em>Virgin and Child with Saint Catherine of Alexandria</em> (60.71.5</a>), which dates from the artist's "second Antwerp period" of 1628&#150;32. Most of van Dyck's remaining years were spent in England, where he was knighted by Charles I and effectively created the enduring image of the Stuart court (89.15.16</a>).</p><p>Van Dyck's brilliant brushwork, graceful arrangement of elegant figures, and seemingly effortless displays of luxurious drapery occasionally make him appear a more superficial master than Rubens. A fair number of the later English portraits</a>, which are often largely by assistants, support this view. However, the lasting importance of direct observation in van Dyck's art is clear in both the style and character of his autograph portraits. Similarly, a sincere emotionalism lends substance to the seemingly nervous manner of his religious pictures. Perhaps only a temperamental prodigy with astonishing natural talent could learn so much from Rubens and at the same time become a great master of a very different kind.</P>

<a id="heilbrunnLink5" href="#"><strong>Peter Paul Rubens (1577&ndash;1640) and Anthony van Dyck (1599&ndash;1641): Works on Paper</strong></a></br>
<div id="heilbrunn5">

<P><P>The seventeenth-century Flemish artists Rubens and van Dyck are among the finest draftsmen of all times. From simple pen-and-brown-ink studies to oil sketches, each used a broad range of drawing techniques. The works they left behind probably count, respectively, some 700 and 200 sheets. Besides being draftsmen, both influenced the art of printmaking</a>: Rubens by employing many talented reproductive engravers to disseminate his work, and van Dyck, a gifted etcher himself, by creating a portrait gallery of prints of famous contemporaries, the so-called <em>Iconography</em> (50.583.4</a>).</P></P>



		<p><P><strong>Peter Paul Rubens</strong><br />The execution of Rubens's drawings varies greatly depending on their function. His first design for a given composition was generally a rapid sketch, usually in pen and brown ink and wash. Such <em>primi pensieri</em> (first thoughts) were little more than summary outlines, as can be seen in <em>The Virgin Adored by Saints</em> (2002.12a</a>, recto), the first study for Rubens's colossal 1628 painting for the high altar of the Church of the Augustinian Fathers in Antwerp (now Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp). The pen strokes in these sketches, dashed off without much hesitation and very abstract, are often sharp and angular. (Because of their minor importance in studio terms, relatively few of these sketches have survived.) The next stage was to prepare a colored and detailed modello or oil sketch to be shown to the customer. <em>The Coronation of the Virgin</em> (1984.433.336</a>) is an example of such a presentation piece. Finally, Rubens would work out the details by making drawings "from life," for which models posed (<em>Saint Catherine</em>, Albertina, Vienna). For this kind of drawing, the artist preferred chalk&#151;usually black heightened by softer white, but often red as well for the flesh tones. To begin the actual painting, Rubens would lay down the composition with brush and dark brown oil paint on the panel or canvas. Then he or his assistants would set about executing the work in oils with the help of the preparatory drawings.</p><p>Of course, Rubens did not always follow the same procedure in every detail. He also made different kinds of drawings that were not in a direct way preparatory for another work. For example, he occasionally made portrait drawings of family, friends, patrons, or other influential or unusual people who crossed his path, such as the Jesuit Nicolas Trigault (1999.222</a>), who was recorded in Chinese costume. Furthermore, as one would expect from a great humanist, Rubens admired and copied antique sculpture (2002.12b</a>, verso) and works by Italian Renaissance masters such as Raphael (1995.401</a>). Such drawings were not merely exercises for the hand and eye: they provided a rich quarry to which the artist could return to stimulate his imagination and cull material for his work.</p><p>Rubens also made an important contribution to the art of engraving</a>. Just like the sixteenth-century Italians, he found prints a convenient way of disseminating his work. Lucas Vorsterman was the first engraver to work for him on a regular basis: between 1619 and 1622, Vorsterman made numerous engravings after Rubens's religious and secular compositions, such as the <em>Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence</em> (51.501.7125</a>) after the painting now in Munich. Other reproductive engravers who collaborated with Rubens were Paulus Pontius, who specialized in portrait engravings, and the Bolswert brothers, famous for their engravings after Rubens's landscapes. Christoffel Jegher made woodcuts</a> of high quality during the mid-1630s, for example, after Rubens's composition of <em>The Garden of Love</em> (30.53.17a,b</a>). The working drawings for these prints were often carried out by the printmakers themselves. However, in some cases Rubens corrected or retouched them with pen and ink or gouache, as he did in the two working drawings for <em>The Garden of Love</em> woodcuts (58.96.1,.2</a>). Some of the designs after Rubens's paintings, made in preparation for Vorsterman's reproductive engravings, have been attributed to Anthony van Dyck, for example the <em>Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence</em> (61.68</a>). Rubens attached great importance to all of these reproductions. He sought and obtained a privilege or copyright entitling him to publish them in the Netherlands as well as in France.</p><p><strong>Anthony van Dyck</strong><br />Rubens's ablest pupil and assistant was Anthony van Dyck, who worked with him on several commissions between 1618 and 1620. Compared with Rubens's drawn oeuvre, that of van Dyck is not as varied. For instance, he left us no designs for book illustrations or for large decorative schemes, such as tapestries</a> or pictures in monumental series. On the other hand, drawing landscapes seems to have been more important for van Dyck than for Rubens.</p><p>Van Dyck's drawings fall into various categories: compositional sketches and detailed studies for paintings, portraits, and landscape studies and designs for prints. In preparing a painting, van Dyck in his early years followed the manner Rubens had introduced in Antwerp. He made free compositional drawings in pen and brown ink and wash, such as <em>Christ and the Pharisees</em> (1980.515</a>) or <em>Study of Count Albert of Arenberg</em> (40.91.16</a>). The latter was the initial concept for the lifesize painting at Holkham Hall, Norfolk. This stage would be followed by chalk studies from the live model, not in "trois crayons" as are those by Rubens, but in black chalk heightened with white. The next stage was a modello drawing.</p><p>Van Dyck probably also collaborated on Rubens's large-scale project to have prints made after his paintings. A group of finished black chalk drawings dating from around 1620 after paintings by Rubens have been attributed to him, among them possibly the Museum's <em>Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence</em> (61.68</a>). These are all preparatory drawings for engravings by Lucas Vorsterman (51.501.7125</a>). Van Dyck also used black chalk to prepare his portrait paintings, as seen in <em>Study for a Portrait of a Lady</em> (1972.118.279</a>). Instead of the white paper of his early period, he used for these drawings&#151;as well as for figure studies&#151;either granular paper with gray, green, or brown tint, or the Venetian <em>carta azzurra </em>(blue paper).</p><p>Most of van Dyck's landscapes date from his later years, the 1630s. A small group comprises topographical scenes carefully and painstakingly executed in the old Flemish tradition. Most of the studies, however, show a broader sweep, a greater freedom in the handling of line and use of wash that had rarely been seen in the Northern countries (2003.27</a>). This new conception of landscape seems to be the fruit of van Dyck's study of the Bolognese painters and his stay in Rome. He is also one of the first artists to use watercolor in his landscapes, which would become an influential source for the later British landscape watercolorists. It is unclear why van Dyck produced these drawings, but in view of the many landscapes that are signed and dated, it would seem that he intended them as independent works and may have given them away to connoisseurs.</p><p>The <em>Iconography</em> was a collection of portrait prints made after drawings and paintings by van Dyck. Eighteen were etched</a> by the artist himself, among which is his self-portrait (50.583.4</a>). The majority, however, are engravings made by a variety of printmakers. This anthology of portraits of artists, soldiers, statesmen, administrators, and scholars, a conspectus of the most distinguished men and women of his time, went through many editions. The edition published by Martinus van den Enden during van Dyck's lifetime consisted of eighty portraits. Van Dyck prepared these prints by making oil sketches and drawings in black chalk (see, for example, the portrait of Caspar Gevartius in the Albertina, Vienna), sometimes washed with brown ink.</P>

<a id="heilbrunnLink6" href="#"><strong>The Development of the Recorder</strong></a></br>
<div id="heilbrunn6">

<P><P><strong>The Recorder in the Renaissance</strong>


		<p><P>Most Renaissance recorders were constructed from a single piece of undecorated wood with a predominantly cylindrical bore. The instrument had a relatively narrow range of an octave and a sixth, with a rich timbre, perfect for blending in an ensemble. Makers would construct matched consorts of various sizes of recorders, from the smallest&#151;only a few inches long&#151;to the largest, which might measure more than six feet. A full family of recorders was needed for playing the notated polyphonic repertory of the period&#151;motets, secular songs, fantasias, canzonas, and arrangements of dances&#151;music made commonly available in the sixteenth century by the invention of music printing in 1501. A typical recorder ensemble, as described by music theorists Sebastian Virdung (1511) and Martin Agricola (1532) and illustrated by Michael Praetorius (<em>Syntagma musicum</em>, 1614&#150;20) and Marin Mersenne (<em>Harmonie universelle</em>, 1636&#150;37), might comprise an alto in G', two tenors in C', and a basset in F [recorder consort from Praetorius</A>]. King Henry VIII (r. 1509&#150;47), an avid amateur musician, by the end of his life owned seventy-six recorders, undoubtedly organized in several matched choirs. They were likely played by the five members of the Bassano family, the royal professional recorder consort, as well as by Henry himself. The Museum's tenor recorder in C' (89.4.3133</A>), while possibly constructed in the seventeenth century, is a typical Renaissance-style recorder, made from a single piece of maple, simple in appearance, with twin finger holes on the bottom, allowing the player the option of playing left- or right-handed after plugging the unused hole.</p><p><strong>The Recorder in the Late Sixteenth and Early Seventeenth Centuries</strong><br />During the sixteenth century and into the seventeenth, a new music aesthetic emerged in western Europe, emphasizing the soloist's ability to express emotion and to dazzle with virtuosity. The years around 1600 marked the birth of opera</a>, the rise of music making in public concert halls and theaters (with the attendant need for performers to project to and impress an audience), and further growth in the businesses of music publishing and instrument building. In order to extend the recorder's musical range, the bore of many smaller recorders in the first half of the seventeenth century featured a "choke" or narrowing near the lowest finger hole. (See Anthony van Dyck's</a> painting <em>Lucas van Uffel</em>, 14.40.619</a>, which includes a seventeenth-century-style recorder as one of the possessions of a cultured gentleman.) The instrument's wider range, along with the early Baroque interest in virtuosity, is particularly demonstrated in <em>Der Fluyten Lust-hof</em>, an enormous mid-seventeenth-century collection for soprano recorder of virtuosic variations on popular tunes improvised by the blind Dutch carillonneur Jacob van Eyck (1589/90&#150;1657).</p><p>The recorder in this period was associated in opera and art with pastoral and erotic themes (for example, respectively, Georges de La Tour's <em>Adoration of the Shepherds</em> at the Louvre, Paris; Titian's</a> <em>Reclining Woman with Lute</a> Player</em> at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge; and Caravaggio's</a> <em>Musicians</em>, 52.81</a>). Claudio Monteverdi (1567&#150;1643), among several Italian early opera composers, specified the recorder for a number of scenes in his Arcadian opera <em>Orfeo</em> (1607), incidentally, the earliest known writing for recorder with basso continuo. Jean-Baptiste Lully (1632&#150;1687), Henry Purcell (1659&#150;1695), and, a bit later, Georg Frideric Handel (1685&#150;1759) included it in several vocal and stage works to symbolize lamentation, death, and the supernatural, as well as the pastoral.</p><p><strong>The Recorder in the Late Seventeenth and Early Eighteenth Centuries</strong><br />In the second half of the seventeenth century, the recorder, along with the transverse flute, oboe, and bassoon, underwent a redesign that radically altered its capabilities, ushering in what we think of as the truly Baroque recorder. This revolution, occurring simultaneously in Italy, France, and elsewhere in Europe, resulted in a recorder with a tapering or conical bore, which required constructing the instrument in three sections or joints. In addition, recorders were adorned with decorative Baroque turnings, which strengthened the joints. The new design gave the upper register of the recorder's range of two octaves and a step more brilliance and reliability.</p><p>While the recorder continued to be built in various sizes for various purposes through the first half of the eighteenth century, by 1690 the alto in F' had emerged as the primary recorder, equivalent as soloist to the flute, oboe, or violin</a>; it was avidly embraced by musical amateurs as well as professional wind players who doubled on recorder. The alto in F' is the recorder for which Handel, Johann Mattheson (1681&#150;1764), Georg Philipp Telemann (1681&#150;1767), Alessandro Scarlatti (1660&#150;1725), Benedetto Marcello (1686&#150;1739), and Antonio Vivaldi (1678&#150;1741) wrote solo sonatas and chamber works with basso continuo accompaniment, and which Johann Sebastian Bach (1685&#150;1750) specified for his second and fourth Brandenburg Concertos and several cantatas, including BWV 106. Vivaldi also composed highly virtuosic concertos for both alto in F' (as did Telemann) and sopranino in F''. The Museum's elaborately carved ivory alto recorder in F' by Johann Benedikt Gahn (active 1698&#150;1711, 89.4.909</a>), who specialized in ivory wind instruments, was an expensive and relatively rare commodity, fit mainly for a wealthy music lover. In contrast, the Museum's boxwood recorder by Johann Wilhelm Oberlender the Elder (1681&#150;1763, 89.4.2208</A>) is more simply decorated with horn and Baroque-style turning, a more typical instrument on which a sonata by Telemann might be played. Like Gahn, Oberlender lived in Nuremberg, an important center of instrument building at this time.</p><p>The recorder gained particular popularity among amateurs in early eighteenth-century England after the French instrument builder Peter (Jaillard) Bressan moved to London, where he flourished from 1688 to 1730. The fourth flute in B flat', a recorder so called because it is pitched a fourth above the alto in F', was the recorder favored by the transplanted French composer Charles Dieupart (ca. 1667&#150;ca. 1740), who also worked in London. The Museum's beautiful ebony and ivory soprano by Thomas Boekhout (1666&#150;1715, 89.4.912</a>) may be an example of such an instrument. Many eighteenth-century examples of the more familiar soprano in C'', tenor in C', and bass in F by makers from all over western Europe are also extant.</p><p>Among the finest recorder makers to follow Peter Bressan was Londoner Thomas Stanesby, Jr. (1692&#150;1754). A few of his recorders, perhaps in response to the growing popularity of the transverse flute by the 1720s, feature foot joints that resembled the tapering end of the flute; the Stanesby alto in F' (1982.390</A>) is such an instrument. In 1732, Stanesby had argued for the adoption of his tenor recorder in C' as a worthy rival to the flute's increasing musical hegemony among professional performers. With larger instrumental ensembles and concert halls, the flute prevailed by mid-century, due to its greater ability to project, and its greater range and dynamic capabilities, becoming a regular member of the classical orchestra. The recorder was left an antiquarian curiosity until its rebirth in the early twentieth century, leading to perhaps its most important historic era.</P>

<a id="heilbrunnLink7" href="#"><strong>English Embroidery of the Late Tudor and Stuart Eras</strong></a></br>
<div id="heilbrunn7">

<P><P>The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries saw a flowering of the art of embroidery</a> for secular use, particularly in England. During the Middle Ages, English artisans were famed throughout Europe for their embroidered church vestments. However, from the time that King Henry VIII severed relations with the Catholic church in 1534 and established the Church of England, the need for elaborately decorated religious vestments and furnishings for worship diminished greatly. But by the late sixteenth century, the taste for rich clothing and domestic decorations</a> increased and a larger portion of society could afford to buy or make these luxury items during the relatively peaceful and prosperous late years of Elizabeth I</a>'s reign.</P></P>



		<p><P>A surprisingly large number of fragile embroidered objects have survived in public and private collections. A variety of contemporary concerns and opinions about nature, faith, family relationships, and the monarchy are reflected in the embroidery designs (39.13.7</a>). This was the favored mode of decoration for household furnishings and fashionable dress, as well as for ceremonial garments and decorations used at the late Elizabethan and early Stuart court.</p><p><B>Production</B><br />High-quality embroidery was produced by a diverse group of people. While this skill is traditionally associated with femininity and the education of young girls, it was in fact practiced by both men and women, children and adults, paid professionals and talented amateurs. It is highly probable that almost all young girls were taught to work with a needle (64.101.1328</a>; 64.101.1327</a>). The type of work taught to a young girl was in large part dependent on her socioeconomic status. Young women who would have to produce their own garments and household textiles, as well make a living, learned plain and practical sewing techniques. Daughters of the gentry and nobility advanced to more elaborate decorative stitches, as part of their preparation for future roles as mistresses of large households. At a time when all textiles were made and decorated by hand, needlework skills</a> were necessary at all levels of society. High praise was given to those young women who excelled in embroidery; it was seen as an indicator of their piety and diligence. For example, young Susanna Perwich (d. 1661) was eulogized by John Bathchiler in "The Virgin's Pattern" for her many virtues, among which was the skill for creating convincingly lifelike pictures:</P><br /><blockquote><P><em>Wax, Straws and Gum,<br>Silks, Gems, and Gold, the total sum<br>Of rich materials she disposed<br>In dainty order, and composed<br>Pictures of men, birds, beasts, and flowers,<br>When leisure served at idle hours.<br>All this so rarely to the Life,<br>As if there were a kind of strife,<br>'Twixt Art and Nature: Trees of fruits<br>With leaves, boughs, branches, body, roots,<br>She made to grow in Winter time,<br>Ripe to the eye, easy to climb.</blockquote></em></p><p>Male professional embroiderers were members of the Worshipful Company of Broderers, chartered during Elizabeth I's reign in 1561. Though guild membership was restricted to men, it is clear from surviving documents that women played an important role in embroidery workshops and as professionals in related textile trades, such as the production of ribbons and trimmings.</p><p><B>Sources for Design: Patterns Books and Prints</B><br />Two categories of design predominate during this period: those based on flora and fauna (both native and exotic), and figural designs illustrating narratives from the Bible.</p><p>The increasing production and popularity of printed pattern books for lace</a> and embroidery in the late sixteenth and seventeenth century speaks to the popularity of decorative embroidery as a pastime among amateurs who could afford to buy books and excelled at fine needlework. The first pattern books were printed on the Continent and imported into England (21.15.2bis</a>). The first English pattern book</a> was published in the 1590s, though the earlier examples are almost entirely copied from German and Italian works. Pictorial designs were also copied from Continental illustrated Bibles and decorative prints of secular subjects such as personifications of the Five Senses, the Four Seasons, or the four known continents (56.597.41[2]</a>).</B></p><p><B>Accessories of Dress</B><br />Ready-made fashionable accessories were available for purchase. New ways of shopping were developing by the early seventeenth century, evidenced by the success of London's Royal Exchange (founded in 1565). An assortment of luxury goods were available in this center for commercial activities, including embroidered objects such as headgear, handkerchiefs, and small decorative bags. These bags and purses have survived in large numbers (29.23.15</a>) and they were used for several purposes: as containers for fragrant herbs and perfumes to help mitigate the strong odors of daily life, and as deluxe gift wrapping for small presents. Yet, of all the accessories of dress</a> that survive, gloves are the objects that are the most evocative of the individual who might have owned and worn them. Gloves were strongly associated with romantic devotion, and may have served as tokens of an engagement, as diamonds rings do today. Therefore, gloves were often decorated with symbols of devotion, such as a heart (28.220.3,.4</a>). Not only were small accessories embellished with embroidery, but portraits from the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century show entire garments covered with decorative stitching. These could reach a high degree of luxury, with the inclusion of stitches using metal threads, pearls, and precious stones. One particularly popular garment was a type of fitted bodice</a> decorated with scrolling vines supporting multitudes of flowers, fruits, small birds, and insects (23.170.1</a>). Variations on this scrolling vine design</a> were also found on men's and women's caps as well as on household furnishings such as cushions.</p><p><B>Interior Furnishings</B><br />In a time when furniture was relatively plain, textiles provided color and comfort to domestic interiors</a>. All manner of household furnishings were decorated with embroidery, from bed sheets and pillows to mirrors and boxes. Tables were covered with carpets</a> imported from the Middle East, small tapestries, or embroidered cloths known as table carpets (54.7.8</a>). When the table was in use for a meal, the colorful embroidered carpet would often be covered with a linen cloth for protection.</p><p>Small boxes, called cabinets or caskets, were popular as luxurious storage containers</a> in England and on the Continent. Collectors might use elaborate cabinets to store their collections of precious stones and natural materials. During the mid-seventeenth century, the fashion for three-dimensional embroidery, known as "raised work" or "embossed work," began to appear on boxes, some of which we know were made by schoolgirls. English embroidered cabinets were usually fitted to hold writing instruments, letters, and other personal items (29.23.1</a>).</p><p>Some of the most exuberant examples of raised work are found on mirror frames (64.101.1332</a>). Many of these compositions place a male and female on either side of the frame. Sometimes these couples are recognizable biblical characters, but often they are unidentified but fashionably dressed men and women who acknowledge each other across the expanse of the mirror glass. In the example illustrated here, the surrounding landscape includes two manor houses, as well as other motifs which suggest that this piece was made to celebrate a marital union</a>.</p><p><B>Religious Themes</B><br />Many embroidered items made for domestic use were embellished with depictions of biblical characters or religious narratives. Despite the Protestant prohibition against idolatry, narrative pictures featuring exemplary characters from the Old Testament were considered acceptable for their educational value. Narratives of popular biblical stories are some of the most frequent types of decoration found on household items such as cushion covers and small cabinets (64.101.1306</a>). Biblical scenes that may seem obscure to a twenty-first-century audience would have been immediately recognizable to sixteenth- and seventeenth-century viewers for whom the Bible was required reading, and even to illiterate contemporaries who regularly attended church services or were familiar with popular prints from illustrated religious texts</a>. A high proportion of embroidered household articles depict stories with female protagonists, reflecting the prominent role that women played in the production and consumption of these items (64.101.1325</a>; 64.101.1335</a>). The most popular narrative found in the surviving embroideries is that of Esther, a Jewish</a> orphan who became a queen of ancient Persia</a>. Esther was regarded as an ideal women and wife&mdash;beautiful and obedient to her husband&mdash;but nonetheless brave and faithful in her service to God and her people.</p><p><B>Floral Imagery</B><br />Natural forms are ubiquitous in English embroidery of the late sixteenth and seventeenth century. Oversized fruits, lush flowers, and small frolicking animals are found among the protagonists in even the most harrowing biblical tales, and these motifs themselves often form the main subject of embroidery of the period (64.101.1284</a>). Embroiderers and other craftspeople had not only needlework pattern books, but also numerous botanical</a> and scientific texts from which to draw motifs and inspiration. The seventeenth century saw a huge increase in the availability of printed material, as well as in a general interest in gardening. Imported flowers, such as tulips, were increasingly common in English gardens. Grafting and other experiments in botany were the subject of popular literature (64.101.1305</a>). The garden</a> itself was already an accepted site for both entertainment and private contemplation (64.101.1314</a>). Nature in all its variety was celebrated as a manifestation of God's abundance and gift to humankind. English embroiderers responded to these themes enthusiastically by creating lively and imaginative compositions.</P>

<a id="heilbrunnLink8" href="#"><strong>Portraiture in Renaissance and Baroque Europe</strong></a></br>
<div id="heilbrunn8">

<P><P>A portrait is typically defined as a representation of a specific individual, such as the artist might meet in life. A portrait does not merely record someone's features, however, but says something about who he or she is, offering a vivid sense of a real person's presence.</p><p>The traditions of portraiture in the West extend back to antiquity and particularly to ancient Greece and Rome, where lifelike depictions of distinguished men and women appeared in sculpture</a> and on coins. After many centuries in which generic representation had been the norm, distinctive portrait likenesses began to reappear in Europe in the fifteenth century. This change reflected a new growth of interest in everyday life and individual identity as well as a revival of Greco-Roman custom. The resurgence of portraiture was thus a significant manifestation of the Renaissance in Europe.</P></P>



		<p><P>The earliest Renaissance portraits were not paintings in their own right but rather important inclusions in pictures of Christian subjects. In medieval art</a>, donors were frequently portrayed in the altarpieces or wall paintings that they commissioned, and in the fifteenth century painters began to depict such donors with distinctive features presumably studied from life. An example is Robert Campin's Merode altarpiece (56.70</a>) of about 1425, in which the man and woman in the left wing have the specificity characteristic of portraiture. Hans Memling's portraits of Tommaso and Maria Portinari (14.40.626-27</a>), painted around 1470, were also probably meant to flank the image of a saint in a small triptych, yet each likeness fills a whole panel and has the emphasis of a portrait in its own right.</p><p>One of the hallmarks of European portraiture is a sense of reality, an apparent intention to depict the unique appearance of a particular person. Each portrait is thus meant to express individual identity, but as Erwin Panofsky recognized, it also "seeks to bring out whatever the sitter has in common with the rest of humanity" (quoted in Shearer West, <em>Portraiture</em> [Oxford, 2004], p. 24). This second aspect of portraiture comes across in the considerable conservatism of the genre: most portraits produced in Renaissance and Baroque Europe follow one of a very small range of conventional formats. The profile view, which was favored in ancient coins, was frequently adopted in the fifteenth century, for instance, in Fra Filippo Lippi's picture of a woman at a window, with a young man peeking in (89.15.19</a>). The three-quarter face, which allows for greater engagement between sitter and viewer, was also widely favored. Petrus Christus</a> used this format in his portrait of a Carthusian monk (49.7.19</a>), which places the sitter in a simply characterized interior, with a horizontal element like a windowsill at the bottom and a glow of light in the left background. Italian painters at the turn of the sixteenth century embraced and refined this formula. Leonardo da Vinci's</a> celebrated portrait of Mona Lisa (ca. 1503&#150;5; Mus&eacute;e du Louvre, Paris), for instance, increases the sense of connection between sitter and viewer by placing the hands on the window ledge; the enigmatic smile departs from the perfect composure seen elsewhere. Raphael's widely imitated portrait of Baldassare Castiglione (ca. 1514; Louvre) uses the half-length format seen in the Mona Lisa but tightens the focus on the sitter by highlighting his lively face against a softly lit gray backdrop.</p><p>Mannerist</a> artists adjusted these conventions to produce works like Bronzino's portrait of a young man (29.100.16</a>) painted in the 1530s: the figure again appears half-length, but the expression is aloof rather than serene, curious pieces of furniture replace the barrier along the lower border, and the hands&#151;the right fingering the pages of a book and the left fixed on the hip&#151;suggest momentary action and bravado rather than quiet dignity. The hand in the book confers an air of learned nonchalance on sitters both like and unlike Bronzino's fashionable young man: it occurs, for instance, in Titian's sensitive portrait of the aged archbishop Filippo Archinto, painted in the 1550s (14.40.650</a>). The hand on hip frequently appears in portraits of rulers or would-be rulers, as in van Dyck's</a> splendid likeness of James Stuart</a>, painted around 1635 (89.15.16</a>). The full-length format, always a costly and grandiose option, increases the sitter's air of power and self-possession. Even greater magnificence is implicit in equestrian portraits, which also had Greco-Roman associations and were much favored in Renaissance and Baroque courts (52.125</a>).</p><p>The conventional aspects of portraiture ensure that each example will bear some resemblance to the next, and yet this general similarity makes the distinctive qualities of each one the more salient. Sometimes the sitter's beauty or demeanor is emphasized, as in Nicholas Hilliard's miniature portrait of a young man (35.89.4</a>) with luxuriant curls and a straightforward gaze. In other examples, a magnificent costume highlights the sitter's wealth and fashionable taste (51.194.1</a>). Other portraits suggest a sitter's profession or interests by including possessions and attributes that characterize him as, for example, a humanist author (19.73.120</a>), an accomplished sculptor (46.31</a>), or an impassioned preacher (65.117</a>). In addition to these rather public aspects of identity, portraits may also suggest the sitter's inner psychology or state of mind. Hints of personality are especially evident in seventeenth-century portrayals of less exalted persons, such as Rembrandt's</a> portrait of the craftsman Herman Doomer (29.100.1</a>), Vel&aacute;zquez's</a> picture of his assistant Juan de Pareja (1971.86</a>), and Rubens'</a> seductive likeness of a woman who may have been his sister-in-law (1976.218</a>).</p><p>In addition to recording appearances, portraits served a variety of social and practical functions in Renaissance and Baroque Europe. Miniatures were given as gifts of intimate remembrance, while portraits of rulers asserted their majesty in places from which they were absent. In courtly settings, portraits often had diplomatic significance. For instance, Jan van Eyck</a> traveled to make portraits (now lost) of potential wives for his patron, Philip the Good of Burgundy</a>, and Girolamo della Robbia made a ceramic portrait of Francis I</a> (41.100.245</a>) to adorn the residence of one of his comrades in arms. A portrait was often commissioned at a significant moment in someone's life, such as betrothal</a>, marriage</a>, or elevation to an office. The making of a portrait typically involved a simple arrangement between artist and patron, but artists also worked on their own initiative, particularly when portraying friends and family (18.72</a>; 1981.238</a>; 1994.7</a>). These portraits sometimes display a sense of affection, informality, or experimentation unusual in commissioned works. Finally, artists captured their own likenesses in self-portraits (49.7.25</a>; 14.40.618</a>), where they freely pursued their own ends, whether to claim elevated status, to showcase technical mastery, or to seek frank self-reflection.</P>

<a id="heilbrunnLink9" href="#"><strong>Low Countries, 1600&ndash;1800 A.D.</strong></a></br>
<div id="heilbrunn9">
<strong>Overview</strong></br>
<P>The seventeenth century is rightly referred to as a Golden Age of Dutch art, as the United Provinces establishes its independence, declared in 1581 and recognized officially in 1648, from Spanish Habsburg rule. Schools of painting arise in cities such as Amsterdam, Delft, Haarlem, Utrecht, and Dordrecht, where a variety of genres are developed and the production of decorative arts flourishes. Civic bodies and wealthy lay citizens, including merchants who make their fortunes in Holland's vast overseas trade empire</a>, are key patrons. Meanwhile, the Southern Netherlands remains under Catholic Habsburg rule, and church commissions proliferate. The port city of Antwerp is a major cultural and commercial center and home to the two greatest Flemish masters of the age: Peter Paul Rubens (1577&#150;1640) and Anthony van Dyck (1599&#150;1641)</a>. The widely traveled Rubens, whose professional life extends beyond visual artistry to political diplomacy, plays a vital role in the spread of Baroque ideals</a> from their fountainhead in Rome to the North.</P>

<P>During the eighteenth century, the Low Countries, exhausted by intermittent wars of the previous century for political independence and trading rights, slips from cultural prominence and wealth. Rival countries England and France meanwhile rise to great political power and economic strength, and are the seat of major intellectual developments that give rise to the Enlightenment and the Neoclassical movement in the arts and architecture. Shortly after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792, the region falls under French occupation. The arts of this time are marked by the influence of French styles: the ornate Rococo and, later, Neoclassicism</a>.</P>

</br>
<strong>Key Events</strong></br>

				<ul>
<strong><P>&#149; by 1600</strong> The glassmaking industry is well established in the Low Countries, and thrives throughout the century, with centers at Antwerp, Li&egrave;ge, Amsterdam, and Middelburg. Drinking vessels such as <I>berkemeyers</I>&#151;glasses with a thick stem and wide funnel-shaped bowl&#151;and <I>roemers</I>&#151;glasses with a hollow stem studded with protruding knob-shaped decorations known as <I>prunts</I>&#151;are widely popular; the most elaborate of these are ornamented with gilt or diamond-point engraving of exquisite detail. Anna Roemers Visscher (1583&#150;1651), a member of the poet Pieter Cornelisz. Hooft's literary circle called the Muiderkring, is one of the finest glass calligraphers of the period: her vessels are inscribed with poetic text, often in several languages, and bear delicately rendered botanicals, insects, and other decorative motifs.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; by early 17th century</strong> Still-life painting</a> flourishes in the Low Countries as an independent genre. Widely popular are <I>vanitas</I> compositions, in which objects such as skulls, bubbles, and timepieces allude to fleeting time and the ephemeral nature of worldly luxuries. Other still lifes seem to celebrate in opulent detail the very same luxuries: floral pictures painted by Balthasar van der Ast, Jan Bruegel the Elder and Younger, and many others combine in a single arrangement coveted and costly blossoms from many countries, while the "banquet" and "breakfast" still lifes of artists such as Pieter Claesz and Willem Claesz Heda allow, in their arrangement of foods, utensils, and drinking vessels, for a display of the painter's ability to render surface detail and texture with astonishing realism.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1603</strong> Hendrick de Keyser (1565&#150;1621) is appointed architect to the city of Amsterdam, where he raises churches, towers, official buildings, and secular structures such as the Zuiderkerk (1603), Westerkerk (1620), and the residence De Dolfijn (1605). The classical vocabulary</a> with which he articulates his architectural designs is carried with even greater emphasis into his sculptural works. In 1608, he produces one of the first marble portrait busts to be made in the Netherlands. Recalling antique Roman portrait sculpture</A> in its pensive dignity and voluminous drapery enrobing the figure, it elevates its burgher subject, Vincent Coster (1553&#150;1608/10), to a classical majesty.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1605</strong> <I>The Golden Age</I> (1993.333</a>), painted in this year by Utrecht artist Joachim Wtewael (1566&#150;1638), exemplifies the Northern Mannerist style</A>&#151;of which Wtewael is a late exponent&#151;in its jewel-like coloring and contorted figures.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; early 17th century</strong> Haarlem is one of the most important cities in the Low Countries, a commercial and cultural center, home to a lively printmaking</a> industry as well as a large community of artists, many of them Flemish settlers who bring the artistic traditions of the Southern Netherlands north to Holland. It is here that landscape painting undergoes a significant development, evolving from the fantastic compositions of the sixteenth century&#151;in which the landscape, though often prominent, usually serves as the setting for a biblical or mythological narrative&#151;to a more naturalistic depiction of nature, in which the landscape itself is more often the subject. Landscape artists active in Haarlem include Salomon van Ruysdael (1600/1603&#150;1670)&#151;who produces tonal pieces in keeping with a style tending toward monochrome that proliferates in the 1620s&#150;50s&#151;and his more famous nephew, Jacob van Ruisdael (1628/29&#150;1682), who brings ambitious composition and an often monumental quality to his canvases, as seen in <I>Wheat Fields</I> (14.40.623). Landscape production thrives in other centers as well. Aelbert Cuyp (1620&#150;1691), active in Dordrecht and producing his mature works at mid-century, is one of the greatest painters in this genre, infusing his landscapes, townscapes, equestrian portraits, cattle pieces, and other compositions with a majesty in part effected by lighting techniques influenced by the Italian Baroque.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1608</strong> Peter Paul Rubens (1577&#150;1640) returns to his native Antwerp after travels in Spain and Italy, where he absorbs the profound influence of classical and Renaissance masterpieces and secures the patronage of the clergy and ruling houses of Mantua, Genoa, and Rome. From this year he serves as official painter to archdukes Albert and Isabella in Brussels, but continues to dwell in Antwerp as one of its most influential citizens. Around this time he produces several of his greatest monumental religious works, including <I>The Raising of the Cross</I> (1610&#150;11; now Antwerp Cathedral) and <I>The Descent from the Cross</I> (1612&#150;14; Antwerp Cathedral). Rubens's urbanity and imagination, matchless versatility and prolific output, personal vitality and, above all, a vitality of technique make him the greatest Flemish artist of the period and one of the most important European artists of the age. Through his deep knowledge of Italian painting, combined with extensive travels as a political emissary, he is a major contributor to the dissemination of Italian Baroque style in the North.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1610</strong> Peter Paul Rubens purchases a sixteenth-century building in Antwerp for use as a residence and studio and, over the next decade, remodels it to his own design. To the existing structure he adds a wing in the style of Italian palazzi, and chooses a decorative program based on classical themes (known and largely reconstructed from prints of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries). The splendid portico in particular, with its Stoic inscriptions and crowning sculptures of Hermes and Athena&#151;who together represent the union of trade and the arts&#151;expresses Rubens's humanist ideology. In a city dominated by Gothic structures</a>, the Rubens House is an outstanding monument of the Baroque and a testament to the artist's erudition as well as his gift for uniting past and present.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1614</strong> Thirty years after the assassination of William the Silent (1533&#150;1584), founder of the Dutch state, Hendrick de Keyser receives the ambitious commission that results in his sculptural masterwork: a tomb for the prince at his heretofore unassuming resting place in the Nieuwe Kerk, Delft. The splendid monument of black and white marble, dinant stone, and bronze bears two lifesize images of the prince: one rests in state under an architectural canopy, presided over by the winged figure of Fame, while the other, at the front of the monument, sits, scepter in hand, as in life. Female figures representing Liberty, Faith, Fortitude, and Justice stand in niches topped by obelisks. The tomb&#151;remarkable in the deft adoption of a classical vocabulary and expressive handling of garment drapery that are the hallmarks of de Keyser's style&#151;is completed in 1621, the year of the master's death.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1620</strong> British nobleman Thomas Howard, second earl of Arundel, discovers Anthony van Dyck</a> (1599&#150;1641), a precociously gifted young painter, at work in the studio of Peter Paul Rubens in Antwerp, and shortly thereafter brings him to London. Van Dyck's stay, though brief, wins him great acclaim among the English nobility. The artist then travels to Italy and France before returning in 1627 to Antwerp, where he works until late 1631. He settles permanently in England in the following year, with a short return to Flanders in 1634&#150;35. Religious works&#151;such as the early altarpiece <I>Saint Augustine in Ecstasy</I> (1628) for the Church of Saint Augustine in Antwerp&#151;are well represented in van Dyck's oeuvre; however, it is as a portraitist</a> of consummate skill, sensitivity, and unrivaled refinement that he is chiefly famed. Also a gifted etcher</a>, he compiles a series of prints</a>, called the <I>Iconography</I>, depicting his most illustrious contemporaries.</li>

<strong><P>&#149; 1620s</strong> In Utrecht, a group of painters led by Hendrick ter Brugghen (1588&#150;1629), Dirck van Baburen (1590/95&#150;1624), and Gerrit van Honthorst (1592&#150;1656) work in a style influenced by Caravaggio</a> (1571&#150;1610), whose paintings they encounter during travel and study in Rome</a>. Known as the Utrecht Caravaggisti, these painters produce works that reflect the innovations of the Roman master in their use of strong contrasts of light and dark, genre and history themes, and compositions of few figures in a cropped or half-length format.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1630s</strong> Painter Frans Hals</a> (1582/83&#150;1666) is at the height of his success as a portraitist, executing single and double portraits as well as large canvases of civic guard companies. Hals's works of these years and earlier employ a vivid palette and loose brushwork to suggest the play of bright light on surfaces; later works are even looser in execution, while the palette becomes more sober. In his paintings, the artist deemphasizes setting and focuses instead on the figure, giving even the characters of a nonspecific genre scene a portraitlike quality (see <I>Young Man and Woman in an Inn</I>, 14.40.602).</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1631</strong> Rembrandt van Rijn</a> (1606&#150;1669) leaves his native Leiden and settles, for the remainder of his life, in Amsterdam. Already prolific as a painter, draftsman, and etcher of many subjects, Rembrandt secures his fame in Amsterdam with the dramatic appeal of his portraits and <I>tronies</I>, bust-length figural compositions&#151;usually incorporating elaborate or exotic costume&#151;drawn or painted from life but not intended as portraits. Rembrandt's greatest aspiration&#151;the depiction of historical scenes&#151;bears abundant fruit in compositions that fuse his gift for narrative with a virtuosic sensitivity as a portraitist. Foremost among these are the group portraits of <I>The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp</I> (1632, Mauritshuis, The Hague) and the so-called <I>Night Watch</I> (1642, Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), painted at the peak of the artist's fame. From this point onward, Rembrandt's works are increasingly pensive and painterly in their execution. The artist's preoccupation with life drawing may be seen in the many studies and self-portraits he executes throughout his career. In addition to portraits and histories, Rembrandt produces genre scenes and landscapes; his rounded mastery of several media, combined with extraordinary descriptive ability, make him the greatest Dutch artist of his century, a title acknowledged in his own lifetime in the Low Countries and beyond.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1631</strong> After three years of study with Rembrandt, Gerrit Dou (1613&#150;1675) establishes his reputation as a master skilled in small-format pictures of high finish and minute detail. He is the earliest and most influential of a group of Leiden artists known as "fine painters," or <I>fijnschilders</I>, whose works bear similar characteristics. Dou develops (1640s) the niche format often used by the <I>fijnschilders</I> to achieve a sense of spatial depth and other illusionistic effects: a window or arch frames the figural subject or interior scene and provides a ledge for the arrangement of still-life objects. He also explores the evocative potential of artificial illumination in night scenes lit by candle, lantern, or hearth. Although Dou and his pupils Frans van Mieris the Elder (1635&#150;1681) and Pieter Cornelisz. van Slingeland (1640&#150;1691) are the finest practitioners of the genre, several generations of <I>fijnschilders</I> thrive in Leiden through the first half of the eighteenth century.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; ca. 1635</strong> Judith Leyster (1609&#150;1660), one of the few influential Dutch female painters of this period, executes <I>The Young Flute Player</I> (Nationalmuseum, Stockholm). This masterful work, in its half-length format, simplicity of composition, tonality, and illumination, is well informed by the Utrecht Caravaggisti as well as by other masters&#151;particularly Frans Hals</a>&#151;active in Haarlem, the center of Leyster's activity.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; ca. 1636</strong> Active in Antwerp, Adriaen Brouwer (1606?&#150;1638) paints <I>The Smokers</I> (32.100.21), a panel in which the artist wittily portrays himself, the artist Jan Davidsz de Heem, and another companion partaking of one of the most popular pastimes of the period. The panel illustrates two of Brouwer's most important contributions to genre painting in the Low Countries: the introduction of an interior setting to peasant or "low-life" scenes&#151;in which drinking parties, card games, and brawls are carried out, often with a moralizing intent that nonetheless has a humorous aspect&#151;and the exploration of facial expression as a graphic means of conveying extremes of emotion, from the inebriated merriment of revelers in a tavern to the pain of a patient under the surgeon's knife.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1646</strong> Pieter Post (1608&#150;1669), court architect to the Dutch stadholder Frederick Henry, designs a residence in the Hague for Frederick's wife, the princess Amalia von Solms. Called the Huis ten Bosch, the house embodies an architectural style known as Dutch classicism. This movement is inspired by Italian models, with particular attention to Andrea Palladio's</a> theories of proportion, balance, and symmetry. By the end of the century, Dutch classicism reaches such a height of severity that it is called the Austere style: ornament is reduced to a bare minimum in favor of simplified monumentality.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1647</strong> At the cessation of Chinese porcelain export to Europe</a>, local potteries experience a surge of expansion and success. Chief among these are the workshops in Delft; the blue and white tin-glazed earthenware plaques, dishes, and ornamental objects produced in this city often emulate Chinese models in design and ornamental motif, or serve a commemorative function, depicting actual interiors, notable persons, or monuments.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1648</strong> The Dutch Republic is recognized as an independent state at the Peace of Westphalia, the treaty that ends the Thirty Years' War (1618&#150;48). In this year, work is begun on the Stadhuis, or town hall (now Royal Palace), to the design of Jacob van Campen (1595&#150;1657), a major proponent of Dutch classicism. City architect Dani&euml;l Stalpaert (1615&#150;1676) sees the building project through to completion in 1665. Sculptural decoration is executed by the Quellinus family of Antwerp.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1650</strong> Gerrit Houckgeest (ca. 1600&#150;1661) paints the <I>Interior of the Nieuwe Kerk, Delft, with the Tomb of William the Silent</I> (Kunsthalle, Hamburg), his masterpiece and, beyond his own oeuvre, one of the greatest examples of architectural painting. The panel is unprecedented and later unmatched in its spatial fidelity to the subject&#151;achieved by an oblique system of perspective&#151;as well as in its exacting description of interior details. The practice of architectural painting is pioneered in the sensitively handled, light-filled church interiors of Haarlem artist Pieter Saenredam (1597&#150;1665). Other masters of this genre include Hendrick Cornelisz. van Vliet (1611/12&#150;1675) and Emanuel de Witte (ca. 1617&#150;1691/92), a late and exceptionally gifted exponent (see <I>Interior of the Old Church in Delft</I>, 2001.403).</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1650s&#150;60s</strong> Still-life paintings</a> produced in Amsterdam reflect the city's status as a financial center and cultural hub. Artists including Willem Kalf (1619&#150;1693) depict objects&#151;many imported luxury goods&#151;of a degree of splendor unseen in earlier still lifes. Around this time, game pieces featuring dead fowl, rabbits, and other hunting trophies, as well as still lifes with live animals rise in popularity, and allude to the comforts of an aristocratic country life. Notable among the painters of game are Frans Snyders (1579&#150;1657) and Jan Fyt (1611&#150;1661).</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1655</strong> Johannes Vermeer</a> (1632&#150;1675) registers as an independent master in the Delft guild. While most of Vermeer's early pictures stylistically survey the works of other prominent artists of the period, his mature canvases of domestic interiors, usually inhabited by one or two figures, are characterized by compositional clarity, balance, a studied perspective, and painstakingly achieved naturalistic lighting effects. They are moreover imbued with a sense of stillness, reflective quiet, and even isolation. His works relate in many aspects&#151;subject matter, perspectival concerns, and quality of light&#151;to those of Pieter de Hooch (1629&#150;1684), a close contemporary active until about 1661 in Delft.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1661&#150;70</strong> Jan Steen (1626&#150;1679) lives in Haarlem, where he produces masterworks of genre painting</a>. Steen's travels expose him to the prevalent styles and resident masters of various Dutch cities: the meticulously observed and highly finished works of painters from his native Leiden, particularly Frans van Mieris (1635&#150;1681); the spatial and optical innovations of painters active in Delft; and the tradition of "low-life" genre painting practiced in Haarlem and exemplified by the oeuvre of Adriaen van Ostade (1610&#150;1684), possibly Steen's teacher. In his finest works, Steen brings to genre painting a vibrancy that results partly from the relationships he establishes between the figures depicted through expression and gesture&#151;often sly and laden with innuendo&#151;and partly through profuse detail, including objects that may allude to the subject matter, in either their placement or their traditional association. Steen's canvases often illustrate moralizing proverbs and depict the dissolution&#151;especially in the form of a chaotic household&#151;that occurs with gluttony, sloth, or intemperate passions. During his years in Haarlem, he also produces the best of his medical scenes, which usually feature a perplexed doctor who pays a housecall to a young woman suffering not from physical illness but lovesickness.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; late 17th&#150;early 18th century</strong> Brussels, the center of tapestry making</a> in the Netherlands, witnesses its greatest flourishing of production in roughly a century. The grand and theatrical designs provided from about 1610 through the first half of the century by master painters of the Baroque, such as Peter Paul Rubens and Jacob Jordaens (1593&#150;1678), give way during these years to a more refined decorative style influenced by the developing French Rococo.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; ca. 1688</strong> The Li&egrave;ge artist Gerard de Lairesse (1641&#150;1711) paints a monumental series of seven canvases allegorizing princely virtue for the Council Room of the Binnenhof in the Hague. At work in Amsterdam since about 1665, Lairesse establishes a clientele of wealthy elite and the intellectual bourgeoisie who favor his elegant, classicizing compositions, reflective of contemporary French tastes and making a strong departure from the naturalism that has prevailed in Dutch art up to this point.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1737</strong> Jacob de Wit (1695&#150;1754), the foremost Dutch decorative painter of the eighteenth century, completes <I>Moses Choosing the Seventy Elders</I>, one of his masterworks, for the Amsterdam Stadhuis. De Wit works in a florid Rococo style and is well known for his grisailles in imitation of sculptural relief.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1765</strong> The Amsterdam Academy of Drawing is founded, where Jacob Otten-Husly (1738&#150;1796) serves as director. The Academy disseminates the theories of Neoclassicism</a>, informed in great part by contact with France</a>. Otten-Husly's design for the Felix Meritis building (1787), with its colossal Corinthian columns, arched windows, and crowning pediment, attests to the master's understanding of this idiom.</li>

<strong><P>&#149; 1784</strong> Abraham van der Hart (1747&#150;1820), city architect of Amsterdam since 1777, designs the Maagdenhuis, a Catholic home for young women. It embodies a strict Neoclassical style</a> that pervades Dutch architecture in the second half of the eighteenth century.</li>
