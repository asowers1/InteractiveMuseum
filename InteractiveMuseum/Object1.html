    <p>This lush display of poppies, lilacs, and morning glories seems tied to a symbolic commemoration of nature, through its cycle of sleep, death, and rebirth. Demeter’s flower in Greek mythology is the poppy and its presence recalls the goddess' myth of loss and revival with the seasons.</p>
    <p>Cornelis van Spaendonck was born in the Dutch city of Tilburg, but by the age of seventeen he had followed his older brother Gerardus, also a gifted still life artist, to Paris, where they both enjoyed long and successful careers. Cornelis, for example, was director of the great Sèvres porcelain works.</p>
    <p>Although Spaendonck’s work is removed in time by more than a century from the height of flower painting initiated by painters like Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder and Roelant Saverij during the so-called golden age, it shares with the work of these early artists a great technical virtuosity, finish, and sensitivity to lighting in its depiction of a lush cornucopia of flowers that spill over the canvas. Given the later date of Spaendonck’s work, it is generally agreed among scholars that less meaning should be read into the presence and placement of individual flowers, and felt that viewers should merely experience the enjoyment of nature’s generosity and the artist’s skill. Still, it does not seem possible to entirely discount the symbolism of sleep, death, and rebirth in the respective presentation of poppies, lilacs, and morning glories here; along with these, the mindfulness urged by the forget-me-nots at the very center of the composition may assert a commemorative function for this picture. Or, perhaps Spaendonck intended a clever to the tale of the goddess Demeter from classical mythology (whose flower is the poppy) whose loss of her daughter Persephone to Hades, lord of the underworld, for half of each year, was the ancient explanation for the cyclical death and renewal of the natural world in the four seasons.</p>

    <p>Van Spaendonck painted throughout his lifetime, displaying his works in the salons of Paris until 1833. Most of his works were created with oils and gouache, and he is remembered for his still-life of flowers.</p>
    <p>Among his paintings were subjects such as De Fleurs Et Fruits, Vase De Fleurs, Bouquet De Different Fleurs, Fleurs Du Jardin, Corbeille Fleurs, et al. At the time of his death in 1840 there were 29 paintings in his studio, works that were auctioned soon afterwards.</p>
    <p>Cornelis van Spaendonck (7 December 1756 - 22 December 1839) was a Dutch painter who was a native of Tilburg. Van Spaendonck initially worked under artist Guillaume-Jacques Herreyns (1743–1827) in Antwerp, and in 1773 moved to Paris to study and work with his brother, floral painter Gérard van Spaendonck (1746–1822). From 1785 to 1800, Cornelis van Spaendonck was head of the porcelain works at Sèvres. Due to difficulties encountered as an administrator, he was relieved of his directorship in 1800, but remained at Sèvres as a designer and artist until 1808. In 1789 Spaendonck became a member of the Académie des Beaux Arts.</p>
